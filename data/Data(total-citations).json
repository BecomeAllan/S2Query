            "paperAbstract": "Abstract This research applies the meta-heuristic method of ant colony optimization (ACO) to an established set of vehicle routing problems (VRP). The procedure simulates the decision-making processes of ant colonies as they forage for food and is similar to other adaptive learning and artificial intelligence techniques such as Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms. Modifications are made to the ACO algorithm used to solve the traditional traveling salesman problem in order to allow the search of the multiple routes of the VRP. Experimentation shows that the algorithm is successful in finding solutions within 1% of known optimal solutions and the use of multiple ant colonies is found to provide a comparatively competitive solution technique especially for larger problems. Additionally, the size of the candidate lists used within the algorithm is a significant factor in finding improved solutions, and the computational times for the algorithm compare favorably with other solution methods.",

            "paperAbstract": "In the last few years, reinforcement learning (RL), also called adaptive (or approximate) dynamic programming, has emerged as a powerful tool for solving complex sequential decision-making problems in control theory. Although seminal research in this area was performed in the artificial intelligence (AI) community, more recently it has attracted the attention of optimization theorists because of several noteworthy success stories from operations management. It is on large-scale and complex problems of dynamic optimization, in particular the Markov decision problem (MDP) and its variants, that the power of RL becomes more obvious. It has been known for many years that on large-scale MDPs, the curse of dimensionality and the curse of modeling render classical dynamic programming (DP) ineffective. The excitement in RL stems from its direct attack on these curses, which allows it to solve problems that were considered intractable via classical DP in the past. The success of RL is due to its strong mathematical roots in the principles of DP, Monte Carlo simulation, function approximation, and AI. Topics treated in some detail in this survey are temporal differences, Q-learning, semi-MDPs, and stochastic games. Several recent advances in RL, e.g., policy gradients and hierarchical RL, are covered along with references. Pointers to numerous examples of applications are provided. This overview is aimed at uncovering the mathematical roots of this science so that readers gain a clear understanding of the core concepts and are able to use them in their own research. The survey points to more than 100 references from the literature.",

            "paperAbstract": "Since its introduction by George Boole during the mid-1800s, Boolean algebra has become an important part of the lingua franca of mathematics, science, engineering, and research in artificial intelligence, machine learning and data mining. The Boolean reasoning approach has manifestly become a powerful tool for designing effective and accurate solutions for many problems in decision-making and approximate reasoning optimization. In recent years, Boolean reasoning has become a recognized technique for developing many interesting concept approximation methods in rough set theory. The problem considered in this paper is the creation of a general framework for concept approximation. The need for such a general framework arises in machine learning and data mining. This paper presents a solution to this problem by introducing a general framework for concept approximation which combines rough set theory, Boolean reasoning methodology and data mining. This general framework for approximate reasoning is called Rough Sets and Approximate Boolean Reasoning (RSABR). The contribution of this paper is the presentation of the theoretical foundation of RSABR as well as its application in solving many data mining problems and knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) such as feature selection, feature extraction, data preprocessing, classification of decision rules and decision trees, association analysis.",

            "title": "Conflict-directed A* and its role in model-based embedded systems",
            "paperAbstract": "Artificial Intelligence has traditionally used constraint satisfaction and logic to frame a wide range of problems, including planning, diagnosis, cognitive robotics and embedded systems control. However, many decision making problems are now being re-framed as optimization problems, involving a search over a discrete space for the best solution that satisfies a set of constraints. The best methods for finding optimal solutions, such as A^*, explore the space of solutions one state at a time. This paper introduces conflict-directed A^*, a method for solving optimal constraint satisfaction problems. Conflict-directed A^* searches the state space in best first order, but accelerates the search process by eliminating subspaces around each state that are inconsistent. This elimination process builds upon the concepts of conflict and kernel diagnosis used in model-based diagnosis [J. de Kleer, B.C. Williams, Diagnosing multiple faults, Artif. Intell. 32(1) (1987) 97-130; J. de Kleer, A. Mackworth, R. Reiter, Characterizing diagnoses and systems, Artif. Intell. 56 (1992) 197-222] and in dependency-directed search [R. Stallman, G.J. Sussman, Forward reasoning and dependency-directed backtracking in a system for computer-aided circuit analysis, Artif. Intell. 9 (1977) 135-196; J. Gaschnig, Performance measurement and analysis of certain search algorithms, Technical Report CMU-CS-79-124, Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 1979; J. de Kleer, B.C. Williams, Back to backtracking: controlling the ATMS, in: Proceedings of AAAI-86, 1986, pp. 910-917; M. Ginsberg, Dynamic backtracking, J. Artif. Intell. Res. 1 (1993) 25-46]. Conflict-directed A^* is a fundamental tool for building model-based embedded systems, and has been used to solve a range of problems, including fault isolation [J. de Kleer, B.C. Williams, Diagnosing multiple faults, Artif. Intell. 32(1) (1987) 97-130], diagnosis [J. de Kleer, B.C. Williams, Diagnosis with behavioral modes, in: Proceedings of IJCAI-89, 1989, pp. 1324-1330], mode estimation and repair [B.C. Williams, P.

            "paperAbstract": "Many interesting optimization problems have no known fast solution algorithms either because their objective functions are complicated (and possibly discontinuous) or because they contain difficult constraint structures. For such problems, in practice, any near-optimal solution would be desirable if obtained with a reasonable effort. For many problems with difficult objective functions this can be done using probabilistic search methods; however, such methods have no general way of handling constraints. In general, constraints are an integral part of the formulation of any problem. In [6] the authors wrote: \" \u2026Virtually all decision making situations involve constraints. What distinguish various types of problems is the form of these constraints. Depending on how the problem is visualized, they can arise as rules, data dependencies, algebraic expressions, or other forms. Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) have been studied extensively in the operations research (OR) and artificial intelligence (AI) literature. In OR formulations constraints are quantitative, and the solver (such as the Simplex algorithm) optimizes (maximizes or minimizes) the value of a specified objective function subject to the constraints. In contrast, AI research has focused on inference-based approaches with mostly symbolic constraints. The inference mechanism employed include theorem provers, production rule interpreters, and various labeling procedures such as those used in truth maintenance systems. \" In this article we present a new approach to solving numerical optimization problems with linear constraints , based on genetic algorithms. Our new methodology seems to fit between the OR and AI approaches. First, it uses the OR technique for problem representation, i.e. the formulation of constraints is quantitative. On the other hand, our method uses a genetic algorithm, which is considered as an AI based search method.) are a class of stochastic algorithms which simulate both the natural inheritance by genetics and the Darwinian strive for survival. As stated in [4]: \" \u2026the metaphor underlying genetic algorithms is that of natural evolution. In evolution, the problem each species faces is one of searching for beneficial adaptations to a complicated and changing environment. The 'knowledge' that each species has gained is embodied in the makeup of the chromosomes of its members. \" Since the genetic approach is basically an accelerated search of the feasible solution space, introducing constraints can be potentially advantageous and can improve the behavior of the technique by limiting the space to be searched. However, all traditional GA approaches do not use this fact and rather employ techniques \u2026",

Recent advances in computational pipelines, multiphysics solvers, artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, data processing and management tools bring the promise of digital twins and their impact on society closer to reality. Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in many applications. Also referred to as a computational megamodel, device shadow, mirrored system, avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype, there can be no doubt that a digital twin plays a transformative role not only in how we design and operate cyber-physical intelligent systems, but also in how we advance the modularity of multi-disciplinary systems to tackle fundamental barriers not addressed by the current, evolutionary modeling practices. In this work, we review the recent status of methodologies and techniques related to the construction of digital twins mostly from a modeling perspective. Our aim is to provide a detailed coverage of the current challenges and enabling technologies along with recommendations and reflections for various stakeholders.",

Achieving such a flexibility in artificial systems is challenging, even with more and more computational power. Here we investigate the hypothesis that abstraction and hierarchical information-processing might in fact be the consequence of limitations in information-processing power. In particular, we study an information-theoretic framework of bounded rational decision-making that trades off utility maximization against information-processing costs. We apply the basic principle of this framework to perception-action systems with multiple information-processing nodes and derive bounded optimal solutions. We show how the formation of abstractions and decision-making hierarchies depends on information-processing costs. We illustrate the theoretical ideas with example simulations and conclude by formalizing a mathematically unifying optimization principle that could potentially be extended to more complex systems.",

We start by giving an account of the early years when there was important controversy about the suitability of probability for intelligent systems. We then discuss the main milestones for the foundations of graphical models starting with Pearl's pioneering work. Some of the main techniques for problem solving (abduction, classification, and decision-making) are briefly explained. Finally, we propose some important challenges for future research and highlight relevant applications (forensic reasoning, genomics and the use of graphical models as a general optimization tool).",

            "paperAbstract": ": Case-based reasoning (CBR) often shows significant promise for improving the effectiveness of complex and unstructured decision-making. Consequently, it has been applied to various problem-solving areas including manufacturing, finance and marketing. However, the design of appropriate case indexing and retrieval mechanisms to improve the performance of CBR is still a challenging issue. Most previous studies on improving the effectiveness of CBR have focused on the similarity function aspect or optimization of case features and their weights. However, according to some of the prior research, finding the optimal k parameter for the k-nearest neighbor is also crucial for improving the performance of the CBR system. Nonetheless, there have been few attempts to optimize the number of neighbors, especially using artificial intelligence techniques. In this study, we introduce a genetic algorithm to optimize the number of neighbors that combine, as well as the weight of each feature. The new model is applied to the real-world case of a major telecommunication company in Korea in order to build a prediction model for customer profitability level. Experimental results show that our genetic-algorithm-optimized CBR approach outperforms other artificial intelligence techniques for this multi-class classification problem.",

            "paperAbstract": "Experimental investigations by psychologists have revealed significant deviations of actual human decision behavior from classical rational theories of judgment and decision-making. Weakening the assumptions of the latter has led to the development of such new theories such as prospect theory or rank-dependent subjective expected utility theory. Recent work in this area is reviewed with an emphasis on its implications for prescriptive modeling. These implications manifest themselves at every step of the decision analytic process, potentially limiting the effectiveness of these tools. It is proposed that it may be possible to enhance the effectiveness of decision analytic tools or numerical optimization if they are coupled with some symbolic reasoning capability. The relevance of artificial intelligence techniques for enhancing existing decision tools is also discussed. Some links between the descriptive decision research of psychology, prescriptive models of operations research, and symbolic reasoning research of artificial intelligence are shown. >",

            "paperAbstract": "Computers have played an important supporting role in the development of experimental and theoretical sports biomechanics. The role of the computer now extends from data capture and data processing through to mathematical and statistical modelling and simulation and optimization. This paper seeks to demonstrate that elevation of the role of the computer to involvement in the decision-making process, through the use of artificial intelligence techniques, would be a potentially rewarding future direction for the discipline. In the absence of significant previous work in this area, this paper reviews experiences in a parallel field of medical informatics, namely gait analysis. Research into the application of expert systems and neural networks to gait analysis is reviewed, observations made and comparisons drawn with the biomechanical analysis of sports performance. Brief explanations of the artificial intelligence techniques discussed in the paper are provided. The paper concludes that the creation of an expert system for a specific well-defined sports technique would represent a significant advance in the development of sports biomechanics.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract The journal Knowledge-based Systems (KnoSys) has been published for over 25 years, during which time its main foci have been extended to a broad range of studies in computer science and artificial intelligence. Answering the questions: \u201cWhat is the KnoSys community interested in?\u201d and \u201cHow does such interest change over time?\u201d are important to both the editorial board and audience of KnoSys. This paper conducts a topic-based bibliometric study to detect and predict the topic changes of KnoSys from 1991 to 2016. A Latent Dirichlet Allocation model is used to profile the hotspots of KnoSys and predict possible future trends from a probabilistic perspective. A model of scientific evolutionary pathways applies a learning-based process to detect the topic changes of KnoSys in sequential time slices. Six main research areas of KnoSys are identified, i.e., expert systems, machine learning, data mining, decision making, optimization, and fuzzy, and the results also indicate that the interest of KnoSys communities in the area of computational intelligence is raised, and the ability to construct practical systems through knowledge use and accurate prediction models is highly emphasized. Such empirical insights can be used as a guide for KnoSys submissions.",

The architecture of the decision-making process, hereinafter referred to as driving strategy, should allow diversity in decision-making for various traffic situations and modular expandability of the overall intelligence. Besides a reactive response to changes in the dynamic environment, a deliberative component should also be considered to incorporate the future evolution of the environment. This paper presents a novel driving strategy that meets the above requirements. The complex driving task is discretized by organization into a finite set of \u201cbehavioral strategies\u201d through the developed \u201cdecision network\u201d. The decision-making process itself is realized by a nonlinear model predictive approach which is solved using combinatorial optimization formulation. Lastly, the capability of the proposed approach is demonstrated in two freeway situations.",

There is a common trend in modern networks to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to cope with this design complexity. While a number of AI techniques have been profitably employed in the wireless networks community, the well-established AI framework of neural networks (NNs), well known for their remarkable generality and versatility, has been applied in a wide variety of settings in wireless networks. In particular, NNs are especially popular for tasks involving classification, learning, or optimization. In this paper, we provide both an exposition of common NN models and a comprehensive survey of the applications of NNs in wireless networks. We also identify pitfalls and challenges of implementing NNs especially when we consider alternative AI models and techniques. While various surveys on NNs exist in the literature, our paper is the first paper, to the best of our knowledge, which focuses on the applications of NNs in wireless networks.",

This survey offers a detailed literature review based on different types of AI algorithms, their application areas in the petroleum industry, publication year, and geographical regions of their development. For this purpose, we classify AI methods into four main categories including evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, fuzzy logic, and artificial neural networks. Additionally, we examine these types of algorithms with respect to their applications in petroleum engineering. The review highlights the exceptional performance of AI methods in optimization of various objective functions essential for industrial decision making including minimum miscibility pressure, oil production rate, and volume of $$\\hbox {CO}_{2}$$CO2 sequestration. Furthermore, hybridization and/or combination of various AI techniques can be successfully applied to solve important optimization problems and obtain better solutions. The detailed descriptions provided in this review serve as a comprehensive reference of AI optimization techniques for further studies and research in this area.",

            "paperAbstract": "An artificial-intelligence approach is proposed to differentiate various biomedical samples via Raman spectroscopy technology to obtain accurate medical diagnosis and decision making. The complete process consists of noise filtering, fluorescence identification, optimization and elimination, spectral normalization, multivariate statistical analysis, and data clustering, as well as the final decision making. Numerous modeling, intelligent control, and system-identification schemes have been employed. By means of fuzzy control, genetic algorithms, and principal component analysis (PCA), as well as system identification, a systematic intelligent-control approach is formulated, which is capable of classifying diversified biomedical samples. Raman spectra are weak signals whose features are sensitive to a variety of noises, which have to be reduced to an acceptable level. Fuzzy logic has been known to interpret uncertainty, imprecision, and vague phenomena. Thus, a fuzzy controller is used for noise filtering. On the other hand, background fluorescence acts as a secondary intensity component within a raw Raman spectrograph, so its spectral baseline should be determined. By removing background fluorescence, intrinsic Raman spectrum can be extracted in consequence. To optimize this detrend process, genetic algorithms have been implemented for baseline-function global optimization by selecting an optimal combination of individual spectroscopic functions. Normalization is performed by standard normal variate (SNV) afterwards to compensate for scattering effects. Normalized intrinsic spectra can be used for sample differentiation, where the PCA approach distinguishes some signatures from different samples in terms of dominant principal components. Eventually, various principal components are accumulated for clustering using scatter plots. The long-term objective of this intelligent-control approach is to create a real-time technique for sample analysis, using a Raman spectrometer directly mounted at the end-effectors of medical robots, which is to enhance the robotic surgery.",

            "paperAbstract": "Construction projects are, by their very nature, challenging; and project decision makers must work successfully within an environment that is frequently complex and fraught with uncertainty. As many decisions must be made intuitively based on limited information, successful decision making depends heavily on two factors, including the experience of the expert(s) involved and the quality of knowledge accumulated from previous experience. Knowledge, however, is subject to various factors that cause its value and accuracy to deteriorate. Research has demonstrated that artificial intelligence has the potential to overcome these factors. The Evolutionary Fuzzy Support Vector Machine Inference Model (EFSIM), an artificial intelligence hybrid system that fuses together fuzzy logic (FL), a support vector machine (SVM) and fast messy genetic algorithm (fmGA), represents an alternative approach to retaining and utilizing experiential knowledge. A fmGA is used as an optimization tool to search simultaneously for fittest membership functions, defuzzification parameter (dfp) and SVM hyperparameter (herein C and gamma, @c). Two simulations on actual construction management problems demonstrated the EFSIM to be an effective tool for solving various problems in the construction industry.",

Having real-time access to traceability information allows its exploitation, which is the aim of this work. In this paper, the problem of minimizing the cost of products recall is treated. First the raw material dispersion problem is analyzed, in order to determine a risk-level criterion or ''production criticality''. This criterion is used subsequently to optimize deliveries dispatch with the purpose of minimizing the number of batch recalls in case of crisis. This is achieved by implementing decision-making aid tools based on operational research and artificial intelligence.",

In most cases, the researches attempt to model human intelligence by mimicking the brain structure and function, but they ignore an important aspect in human learning and decision making: the artificial emotion. In this paper, we present a new unconstrained global optimization method, hybrid chaos optimization algorithm with artificial emotion (HCOAAE), which avoids trapping to local minima, and improves convergence in large space and high-dimension optimization problems. The main purpose of artificial emotion is to mimic decision making behavior process of humans, to choose most suitable parameters of HCOAAE and decide whether to change current search strategy or not in the next iteration. Numerical simulations of 13 benchmark functions with different dimensions are used to test the performance of HCOAAE. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing methods in terms of convergence speed, computational effectiveness, and numerical stability.",

This study establishes a decision model of search engine ranking for administrators to improve the performances of websites that satisfy users\u2019 needs. To probe into the interrelationship and influential weights among criteria of SEO and evaluate the gaps of performance to achieve the aspiration level in real world, this research utilizes hybrid modified multiple criteria decision-making models, including decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), DEMATEL-based analytic network process (called DANP), and VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR). The empirical findings discover that the criteria of SEO possessed a self-effect relationship based on DEMATEL technique. According to the influential network relation map (INRM), external website optimization is the top priority dimension that needs to be improved when implementing SEO. Among the six criteria for evaluation, meta tags is the most significant criterion influencing search engine ranking, followed by keywords and website design. The evaluation of search engine ranking reveals that the website with lowest gap would be the optimal example for administrators of websites to make high ranking website during the time that this study is executed.",

It makes near-optimal decisions on a variety of online stochastic combinatorial problems in dynamic fleet management, reservation systems, and more. \n \nHere we consider applications in which 1s-AA is not as close to the optimum and propose Amsaa, an anytime multi-step anticipatory algorithm. Amsaa combines techniques from three different fields to make decisions online. It uses the sampling average approximation method from stochastic programming to approximate the problem; solves the resulting problem using a search algorithm for Markov decision processes from artificial intelligence; and uses a discrete optimization algorithm for guiding the search. \n \nAmsaa was evaluated on a stochastic project scheduling application from the pharmaceutical industry featuring endogenous observations of the uncertainty. The experimental results show that Amsaa significantly outperforms state-of-theart algorithms on this application under various time constraints.",

In this study, we take an investigation of the distributed intelligent traffic system by pushing intelligence into connected vehicles in terms of dynamic decision making for traversing a certain area (e.g., roundabout and intersection). In particular, we propose a model for the next generation of intelligent transportation system, which focuses on dynamic decision making of connected vehicles based on Ant Colony Optimization, a typical Swarm Intelligence (SI)-based algorithm. Specifically, we first present a communication framework among connected vehicles for sharing information of traffic flow. Then, by applying the concept of SI, connected vehicles are regarded as artificial ants which are able to self-calculate to make an adaptive decision following the dynamics of traffic flow. Furthermore, for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we have constructed a framework to model and simulate the traffic system in IoT environment. Simulations with different scenarios of transportation systems indicate promising results comparing with previous works.",

            "paperAbstract": "Information fusion is an essential part of numerous engineering systems and biological functions, e.g., human cognition. Fusion occurs at many levels, ranging from the low-level combination of signals to the high-level aggregation of heterogeneous decision-making processes. While the last decade has witnessed an explosion of research in deep learning, fusion in neural networks has not observed the same revolution. Specifically, most neural fusion approaches are ad hoc, are not understood, are distributed versus localized, and/or explainability is low (if present at all). Herein, we prove that the fuzzy Choquet integral (ChI), a powerful nonlinear aggregation function, can be represented as a multilayer network, referred to hereafter as ChIMP. We also put forth an improved ChIMP (iChIMP) that leads to a stochastic-gradient-descent-based optimization in light of the exponential number of ChI inequality constraints. An additional benefit of ChIMP/iChIMP is that it enables explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Synthetic validation experiments are provided, and iChIMP is applied to the fusion of a set of heterogeneous architecture deep models in remote sensing. We show an improvement in model accuracy, and our previously established XAI indices shed light on the quality of our data, model, and its decisions.",

The Colored Petri Net (CPN) formalism has been used as a base to develop a methodology that integrates the features of operational research, artificial intelligence and simulation fields. At the same time, it combines the modeling of discrete event systems with simulation, analysis and system optimization, transforming a conceptual model into a simulation model, and a decision problem into a search problem. The use of the CPN formalism has allowed the integration of all of these different research fields into a unique decision support tool.",

The proposed model generates one-step forward investment decisions. The ANN are used to make the analysis of historical stock returns and to calculate one day forward possible profit, which could be get while following the model proposed decisions concerning the purchase of the stocks. Subsequently the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied for training of ANN. The training of ANN is made through the adjustment of all ANN towards the weights of \"global best\" ANN. The experimental investigations were made considering different forms of decision-making model: different structure ANN, input variables etc. The paper introduces experimental investigation for the evaluation of decision-making model. The experimental results show that the application of the proposed decision-making model lets to achieve better results than the average of the market.",

            "title": "An artificial immune network to control interrupted flow at a signalized intersection",
            "paperAbstract": "Abstract To monitor and control interrupted flow at signalized intersections, several Traffic Signal Control Systems (TSCSs) were developed based on optimization and artificial intelligence techniques. Although learning can provide intelligent ways to deal with disturbances, existing approaches still lack concepts and mechanisms that enable direct representation of knowledge and explicit learning, particularly to capture and reuse previous experiences with disturbances. This article addresses this gap by designing a new TSCS based on innovative concepts and mechanisms borrowed from biological immunity. Immune memory enables the design of a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) System in which cases provide a direct representation of knowledge about disturbances. Immune network theory enables the design of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) mechanism to interconnect cases, capture explicit knowledge about the outcomes (success and failure) of control decisions and enable decision-making by taking advantage of previous outcomes in reaction to new occurrences of disturbances. We provide a detailed description of new learning algorithms, both to create the case-base and to interconnect cases using RL. The performance of the suggested TSCS is assessed by benchmarking it against two standard control strategies from the literature, namely fixed-time and adaptive control using the Longest Queue First \u2013 Maximal Weight Matching (LQF-MWM) algorithm. The suggested TSCS is applied on an intersection simulated using VISSIM, a state-of-the-art traffic simulation software. The results show that the suggested TSCS is able to handle different traffic scenarios with competitive performance, and that it is recommended for extreme situations involving blocked approaches and high traffic flow.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract Widespread adoption of automated decision making by artificial intelligence (AI) is witnessed due to specular advances in computation power and improvements in optimization algorithms especially in machine learning (ML). Complex ML models provide good prediction accuracy; however, the opacity of ML models does not provide sufficient assurance for their adoption in the automation of lending decisions. This paper presents an explainable AI decision-support-system to automate the loan underwriting process by belief-rule-base (BRB). This system can accommodate human knowledge and can also learn from historical data by supervised learning. The hierarchical structure of BRB can accommodates factual and heuristic rules. The system can explain the chain of events leading to a decision for a loan application by the importance of an activated rule and the contribution of antecedent attributes in the rule. A business case study on automation of mortgage underwriting is demonstrated to show that the BRB system can provide a good trade-off between accuracy and explainability. The textual explanation produced by the activation of rules could be used as a reason for denial of a loan. The decision-making process for an application can be comprehended by the significance of rules in providing the decision and contribution of its antecedent attributes.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract In the engineering practice, it frequently occurs that designers, final or intermediate users have to roughly estimate some basic performance or specification data on the basis of input data available at the moment, which can be time-consuming. There is the need for a tool that will fill the missing gap in the optimization problems in engineering design processes, by making use of the advances in the artificial intelligence field. This paper aims to fill this gap by introducing an innovative Design Support System (DesSS), originated from the Decision Support System, for the prediction and estimation of machine specification data such as machine geometry and machine design on the basis of heterogeneous input parameters. As the main core of the developed DesSS, we introduced different machine learning (ML) approaches based on Decision/Regression Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Neighborhood Component Features Selection. Experimental results obtained on a real use case and using two different real datasets demonstrated the reliability and the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The innovative machine learning-based DesSS meant for supporting the designing choice, can bring various benefits such as the easier decision-making, conservation of the company\u2019s knowledge, savings in man-hours, higher computational speed and accuracy.",

Each political decision in fact implies some form of social reactions, it affects economic and financial aspects and has substantial environmental impacts. Improving decision making in this context could have a huge beneficial impact on all these aspects. There are a number of Artificial Intelligence techniques that could play an important role in improving the policy making process such as decision support and optimization techniques, game theory, data and opinion mining and agent-based simulation. We outline here some potential use of AI technology as it emerged by the European Union (EU) EU FP7 project ePolicy: Engineering the Policy Making Life-Cycle, and we identify some potential research challenges.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract Bankruptcy prediction and credit risk analysis is one of the most significant problems in the field of accounting and financial decision making. Developing an effective classification rule induction (CRI) framework for bankruptcy prediction and credit risk analysis in appropriate time is essential to prevent the business communities from being bankrupt. Traditional statistical methods and artificial intelligence techniques play a major role to predict bankruptcy and credit risks. Most of the earlier research works were carried out on quantitative methods, while few studies have proposed on qualitative methods to improvise the performance of bankruptcy prediction models. The discovery of bankruptcy prediction in a qualitative way is an important task because it depends on the subjective knowledge of the experts. In this paper, a unified framework for qualitative and quantitative bankruptcy analysis using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based ant-miner algorithm is proposed. Three different natured datasets are used to present a trustworthy result. For this experiment, we have collected qualitative_bankruptcy dataset and benchmarked by UCI repository. The proposed method is successfully applied and the performance analysis prove that ant-miner method is better than existing classifiers namely Logistic Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) in terms of various performance analysis factors. Furthermore, the proposed ant-miner model is found to be a more suitable method for bankruptcy prediction when compared to other traditional statistical and artificial intelligence techniques.",

Due to its robust and phase-divided structure, the ABC algorithm has been successfully applied to different types of optimization problems. However, some assumptions that are made with the purpose of reducing implementation difficulties about the sophisticated behaviours of employed, onlooker, and scout bees still require changes with the more literal procedures. In this study, the ABC algorithm and its well-known variants are powered by adding a new control mechanism in which the decision-making process of the employed bees managing transitions to the dance area is modeled. Experimental studies with different types of problems and analysis about the parallelization showed that the newly proposed approach significantly improved the qualities of the final solutions and convergence characteristics compared to the standard implementations of the ABC algorithms.",

This paper discusses the intelligence mode of an ANN in grading the diagnosis of liver fibrosis by duplex ultrasonogaphy.Methods239 patients who were confirmed as having liver fibrosis or cirrhosis by ultrasound guided liver biopsy were investigated in this study. We quantified ultrasonographic parameters as significant parameters using a data optimization procedure applied to an ANN. 179 patients were typed at random as the training group; 60 additional patients were consequently enrolled as the validating group. Performance of the ANN was evaluated according to accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Youden\u2019s index and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.Results5 ultrasonographic parameters; i.e., the liver parenchyma, thickness of spleen, hepatic vein (HV) waveform, hepatic artery pulsatile index (HAPI) and HV damping index (HVDI), were enrolled as the input neurons in the ANN model. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the ANN model for quantitative diagnosis of liver fibrosis were 95.0%, 85.0% and 88.3%, respectively. The Youden\u2019s index (YI) was 0.80.ConclusionsThe established ANN model had good sensitivity and specificity in quantitative diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis or liver cirrhosis. Our study suggests that the ANN model based on duplex ultrasound may help non-invasive grading diagnosis of liver fibrosis in clinical practice.",

            "paperAbstract": "Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the process of managing web content in a manner that elevates page rankings in search engines. Among other sectors, academic world is one of the number-one categories for search based on the percentage of web traffic generated through search engine referrals. However, SEO includes a number of factors grouped into two as \u2018on page\u2019 and \u2018off page.\u2019 To obtain maximum benefit from SEO, relevant factors/criteria should be considered using multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods. The focus of this paper is to consider SEO criteria evaluation as a MCDM problem in which the criteria are in different priority levels and the criteria values take the form of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets to facilitate the elicitation of information in hesitate situations. A three-step solution approach is developed: (i) determination of 21 SEO criteria, such as page loading time, page size and meta-keyword (ii) prioritizing the criteria using hesitant fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, and (iii) ranking 70 Turkish websites of the industrial engineering departments using Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. The results show that trust flow and XML sitemap are the determinant criteria among others. Using the proposed method, web designers can approach SEO from weighted criteria perspective.",

Swarm intelligence (SI) provides the possibility of SI behavior through collaboration in individuals that have limited or no intelligence. Its potential parallelism and distribution characteristics can be used to realize global optimization and solve nonlinear complex problems. This paper reviews representative SI algorithms and summarizes their applications in the IoT. The main focus consists in the analysis of SI-enabled applications to wireless sensor network (WSN) and discussion of related research problems in the WSN. Also, we concluded SI-based applications in other IoT fields, such as SI in UAV-aided wireless network. Finally, possible research prospects and future trends are drawn.",

It was shown to make near-optimal decisions on a variety of online stochastic combinatorial problems in dynamic fleet management and reservation systems.Here we consider applications in which 1s-AA is not as close to the optimum and propose Amsaa, an anytime multi-step anticipatory algorithm. Amsaa combines techniques from three different fields to make decisions online. It uses the sampling average approximation method from stochastic programming, search algorithms for Markov decision processes from artificial intelligence, and discrete optimization algorithms.Amsaa was evaluated on a stochastic project scheduling application from the pharmaceutical industry featuring endogenous observations of the uncertainty. The experimental results show that Amsaa significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on this application under various time constraints.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract Prediction of hydrological flow series generated from a catchment is an important aspect of water resources management and decision making. The underlying process underpinning catchment flow generation is complex and depends on many parameters. Determination of these parameters using a trial and error method or optimization algorithm is time consuming. Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based machine learning techniques including Artificial Neural Network, Genetic Programming (GP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) replaced the complex modeling process and at the same time improved the prediction accuracy of hydrological time-series. However, they still require numerous iterations and computational time to generate optimum solutions. This study applies the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to hydrological flow series modeling and compares its performance with GP and Evolutionary Computation based SVM (EC-SVM). The robustness and performance of ELM were studied using the data from two different catchments located in two different climatic conditions. The robustness of ELM was evaluated by varying number of lagged input variables the number of hidden nodes and input parameter (regularization coefficient). Higher lead days prediction and extrapolation capability were also investigated. The results show that (1) ELM yields reasonable results with two or higher lagged input variables (flows) for 1-day lead prediction; (2) ELM produced satisfactory results very rapidly when the number of hidden nodes was greater than or equal to 1000; (3) ELM showed improved results when regularization coefficient was fine-tuned; (4) ELM was able to extrapolate extreme values well; (5) ELM generated reasonable results for higher number of lead days (second and third) predictions; (6) ELM was computationally much faster and capable of producing better results compared to other leading AI methods for prediction of flow series from the same catchment. ELM has the potential for forecasting real-time hydrological flow series.",

The covering and discovering processes are formulated as DM/OCS problems. Some illustrative examples of challenging problems that cannot be solved by traditional decision making/optimization techniques are formulated as DM/OCS problems and solved.

With the emergence of new requirements for electrical power markets, it has become fundamental to develop tools to aid in decision making, understanding the functioning of markets and forecast iterations that occur between the different entities in the market. Artificial intelligence plays a crucial role in the development of these tools. Using artificial intelligence techniques, it is possible to simulate the different existing players in the market, to enable these players to be adaptive to any situation, and to model any type of trading. Artificial intelligence based metaheuristic optimization tools allow solving problems in a short time, and with very close results to those that deterministic techniques are able to achieve, at the cost of a high execution time. The achieved results, using a simulation scenario based on real data from the Iberian electricity market, show that the proposed method is able to reach better results than previous implementations of a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and a Simulated Annealing (SA) methods, while achieving very similar objective function results to those of a deterministic approach, in a much faster execution time.",

            "paperAbstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly gaining popularity, especially with the advent of many artificial intelligence (AI) driven applications and expert systems. Such applications require specific relevant sensors\u2019 data to be stored, processed, analyzed, and input to the expert systems. Obviously, sensor nodes (SNs) have limited energy and computation capabilities and are normally deployed remotely over an area of interest (AoI). Therefore, proposing efficient protocols for sensing and sending data is paramount to WSNs operation. Nodes\u2019 clustering is a widely used technique in WSNs, where the sensor nodes are grouped into clusters. Each cluster has a cluster head (CH) that is used to gather captured data of sensor nodes and forward it to a remote sink node for further processing and decision-making. In this paper, an optimization algorithm for adjusting the CH location with respect to the nodes within the cluster is proposed. This algorithm aims at finding the optimal CH location that minimizes the total sum of the nodes\u2019 path-loss incurred within the intra-cluster communication links between the sensor nodes and the CH. Once the optimal CH is identified, the CH moves to the optimal location. This suggestion of CH re-positioning is frequently repeated for new geometric position. Excitingly, the algorithm is extended to consider the inter-cluster communication between CH nodes belonging to different clusters and distributed over a spiral trajectory. These CH nodes form a multi-hop communication link that convey the captured data of the clusters\u2019 nodes to the sink destination node. The performance of the proposed CH positioning algorithm for the single and multi-clusters has been evaluated and compared with other related studies. The results showed the effectiveness of the proposed CH positioning algorithm.",

Two key approaches to this problem are reinforcement learning (RL) and planning. This paper presents a survey of the integration of both fields, better known as model-based reinforcement learning. Model-based RL has two main steps. First, we systematically cover approaches to dynamics model learning, including challenges like dealing with stochasticity, uncertainty, partial observability, and temporal abstraction. Second, we present a systematic categorization of planning-learning integration, including aspects like: where to start planning, what budgets to allocate to planning and real data collection, how to plan, and how to integrate planning in the learning and acting loop. After these two key sections, we also discuss the potential benefits of model-based RL, like enhanced data efficiency, targeted exploration, and improved stability. Along the survey, we also draw connections to several related RL fields, like hierarchical RL and transfer, and other research disciplines, like behavioural psychology. Altogether, the survey presents a broad conceptual overview of planning-learning combinations for MDP optimization.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract Digital collectible card games are not only a growing part of the video game industry, but also an interesting research area for the field of computational intelligence. This game genre allows researchers to deal with hidden information, uncertainty and planning, among other aspects. This paper proposes the use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to develop agents who play a card game, Hearthstone, by optimizing a data-driven decision-making mechanism that takes into account all the elements currently in play. Agents feature self-learning by means of a competitive coevolutionary training approach, whereby no external sparring element defined by the user is required for the optimization process. One of the agents developed through the proposed approach was runner-up (best 6%) in an international Hearthstone Artificial Intelligence (AI) competition. Our proposal performed remarkably well, even when it faced state-of-the-art techniques that attempted to take into account future game states, such as Monte-Carlo Tree search. This outcome shows how evolutionary computation could represent a considerable advantage in developing AIs for collectible card games such as Hearthstone.",

Technology like social networks, artificial intelligence and automation impacts life at work, at home, and in the political sphere. When work is supported by decision support systems and self-optimization, human interaction with such systems is reduced to key decision making aspects using increasingly complex interfaces. Both, algorithms and human operators become linchpins in the opaque workings of the complex socio-technical system. Similarly, when looking at human communication flows in social media, algorithms in the background control the flow of information using recommender systems. The users react to this filtered flow of information, starting a feedback-loop between users and algorithm\u2014the filter bubble. Both scenarios share a common feature: complex human-algorithm interaction. Both scenarios lack a deep understanding of how this interaction must be properly designed. We propose the use of agent-based modeling to address the human-in-the-loop as a part of the complex socio-technical system by comparing several methods of modeling and investigating their applicability.",

The ANN are used to make the analysis of daily stock returns and to calculate one day forward decision for purchase of the stocks. Subsequently the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied in order to select the \u201cthe best\u201d ANN for the future investment decisions and to adapt the weights of other networks towards the weights of the best network. The experimental investigations were made considering different forms of decision-making model: different number of ANN, ANN inputs, sliding windows, and commission fees. The paper introduces the decision-making model, its evaluation results and discusses its application possibilities.",

            "paperAbstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches in combination with Raman spectroscopy (RS) to obtain accurate medical diagnosis and decision-making is a way forward for understanding not only the chemical pathway to the progression of disease, but also for tailor-made personalized medicine. These processes remove unwanted affects in the spectra such as noise, fluorescence and normalization, and help in the optimization of spectral data by employing chemometrics. Methods: In this study, breast cancer tissues have been analyzed by RS in conjunction with principal component (PCA) and linear discriminate (LDA) analyses. Tissue microarray (TMA) breast biopsies were investigated using RS and chemometric methods and classified breast biopsies into luminal A, luminal B, HER2, and triple negative subtypes. Results: Supervised and unsupervised algorithms were applied on biopsy data to explore intra and inter data set biochemical changes associated with lipids, collagen, and nucleic acid content. LDA predicted specificity accuracy of luminal A, luminal B, HER2, and triple negative subtypes were 70%, 100%, 90%, and 96.7%, respectively. Conclusion: It is envisaged that a combination of RS with AI and ML may create a precise and accurate real-time methodology for cancer diagnosis and monitoring.",

            "paperAbstract": "Sequential decision making, commonly formalized as Markov Decision Process optimization, is a key challenge in artificial intelligence. Two successful approaches to MDP optimization are planning and reinforcement learning. Both research fields largely have their own research communities. However, if both research fields solve the same problem, then we should be able to disentangle the common factors in their solution approaches. Therefore, this paper presents a unifying framework for reinforcement learning and planning (FRAP), which identifies the underlying dimensions on which any planning or learning algorithm has to decide. At the end of the paper, we compare - in a single table - a variety of well-known planning, model-free and model-based RL algorithms along the dimensions of our framework, illustrating the validity of the framework. Altogether, FRAP provides deeper insight into the algorithmic space of planning and reinforcement learning, and also suggests new approaches to integration of both fields.",

            "paperAbstract": "Hybrid intelligent systems (HIS) are very successful in tackling problems comprising of more than one distinct computational subtask. For instance, decision-making problems are good candidates for HIS because of their frequent dual nature. This is because supporting decision-making most often involves two phases: (i) forecasting decision scenarios and (ii) searching in those scenarios. In addition to reducing the inherent uncertainty and effort in decision making, previous works in the area of decision support have shown that some of the inconveniences of the dasiaInverse Problempsila can be overcome by the use of Hybrid Intelligent Decision Suites (HIDS). This paper extends HIDS by including a third module that deals with multi-objective (MO) tasks through Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization (EMOO). This EMOO module helps by creating the Pareto front for each forecast scenario produced by Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), acting here as the predictive engine of the decision support system. In order to interface better with decision makers, we use a fuzzy-heuristic module of the original HIDS. To test this concept we have applied our new approach to two distinct problems: (1) diagnosis of heart diseases (of the proben-1 data-set) and (2) automobile feature selection (of UCI data-set). Results have indicated that this new ensemble of intelligent techniques enhances the quality of decision making.",

            "paperAbstract": "The paper describes a new approach to the modelling of the individual-based artificial life model based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM). The proposed concept focuses on the optimization of artificial intelligence of individuals in multi-agent models and their adaptation to environment. In this process of optimization, emphasis is put on the decision-making method. FCM offers great complexity and learning through evolutionary algorithms. However, too large FCMs suffer from performance issues. Therefore, this paper presents a possibility to replace a decision-making part of large FCM with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, which is widely used, especially for decision support. In comparison with the large FCM model, a combination with AHP provides a model with lower computational demands while keeping nearly the same complexity.",

            "paperAbstract": "The traditional production paradigm of large batch production does not offer flexibility toward satisfying the requirements of individual customers. A new generation of smart factories is expected to support new multivariety and small-batch customized production modes. For this, artificial intelligence (AI) is enabling higher value-added manufacturing by accelerating the integration of manufacturing and information communication technologies, including computing, communication, and control. The characteristics of a customized smart factory are: self-perception, operations optimization, dynamic reconfiguration, and intelligent decision-making. The AI technologies will allow manufacturing systems to perceive the environment, adapt to the external needs, and extract the process knowledge, including business models, such as intelligent production, networked collaboration, and extended service models. This article focuses on the implementation of AI in customized manufacturing (CM). The architecture of an AI-driven customized smart factory is presented. Details of intelligent manufacturing devices, intelligent information interaction, and construction of a flexible manufacturing line are showcased. The state-of-the-art AI technologies of potential use in CM, that is, machine learning, multiagent systems, Internet of Things, big data, and cloud-edge computing, are surveyed. The AI-enabled technologies in a customized smart factory are validated with a case study of customized packaging. The experimental results have demonstrated that the AI-assisted CM offers the possibility of higher production flexibility and efficiency. Challenges and solutions related to AI in CM are also discussed.",

These information are mostly text documents such as news, reports, which can provide useful insight into various aspects about corporations. In order to extract useful information from this huge and diverse collection of texts, appropriate state-of-the-art text mining techniques are necessary. In this paper, a novel multi-document extractive text summarization technique, based on topic identification and artificial bee colony optimization, is described which can be used by companies for extracting important facts from the product-specific news items of their competitors and subsequently use them as one of the inputs for strategic business decision making. The results presented in this paper are based on the corpus created by collecting news items for a specific consumer electronics company from authentic news sites available on the internet. The quality of summary generated using this approach is found to be better on many aspects as compared to summaries generated by a well-known benchmark summarizer called MEAD.",

            "paperAbstract": "PURPOSE\nConventional portal verification requires that a qualified radiation oncologist make decisions as to the set-up acceptability. This scheme is no longer sustainable with the large numbers of images available on-line and stringent time constraints. Therefore the objective of this study was to develop, optimize, and evaluate on clinical data an artificial intelligence decision-making tool for portal verification. The tool, based on the artificial neural network (ANN) approach, should approximate, as closely as possible, portal verification assessments made by a radiation oncologist expert.\n\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS\nA total of 328 electronic portal images of tangential breast irradiations were included in the study. A radiation oncologist expert evaluated these images and rated the treatment set-up acceptability on a scale from 0 to 10. Translational and rotational errors in the placement of the radiation field boundaries formed seven-dimensional feature vectors that represented each of the 328 portal images/treatments. The feature vectors were used as inputs to a three-layer, feedforward ANN. The neural network was trained on the oncologist's ratings.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe rms discrepancy between the ANN and the expert's ratings was 1.05 rating points. Using the decision threshold equal to 5 for both sets of ratings, the ANN classifier was capable of detecting 100% of the portals classified as \"unacceptable\" by the expert. Only 6.5% of portals acceptable to the oncologist were misclassified as \"unacceptable\" by the ANN.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of this study indicate the feasibility of using the ANN portal image classifier as an automated assistant to the radiation oncologist. Its role would be to recommend an appropriate decision as to the acceptability or otherwise of a given treatment set-up depicted in a portal image.",

On the basis of the integrated techniques of qualitative and quantitative analysis, the multiple objective intelligence-integrated methodology for decision-making on mineral resource exploitation was investigated and its integrated model was also formulated. The mineral deposit model, expert system model for mining method selection and the artificial neural network model for prediction economic index, as well as the programming model, acted as the core of this system, while the multiple goal programming model served as the top of the model. An intelligent system to assist the programming of decision-making on mineral resource exploitation for operating mines was developed by means of the systematic combination of optimization technology with an artificial neural network, an expert system, computer-aided design and operations research (OR). The structure of an integrated intelligent system for decision-making on mineral resource exploitation was described. In addition, forecast and simulation, as well as optimization, were integrated. The system's preliminary application was illustrated with an example.",

Our work addresses theoretical questions in this model which are motivated by the work of Deng and Papadimitriou [ Proc. 12th IFIPS Congress, Madrid, 1992; Proc. World Economic Congress, Moscow, 1992]. We consider optimization problems, in particular load balancing and virtual circuit routing, in which the input is divided among the agents. An underlying directed graph, whose nodes are the agents, defines the constraints on the information each agent may have about the portion of the input held by other agents. The questions we discuss are as follows: Given a bound on the maximum out-degree in this graph, which is the best graph? What is the quality of the solution obtained as a function of the maximum out-degree?",

In this paper, we review a specific subset of this literature, namely work that utilizes optimization criteria based on average rewards, in the infinite horizon setting. Average reward RL has the advantage of being the most selective criterion in recurrent (ergodic) Markov decision processes. In comparison to widely-used discounted reward criterion, it also requires no discount factor, which is a critical hyperparameter, and properly aligns the optimization and performance metrics. Motivated by the solo survey by Mahadevan (1996a), we provide an updated review of work in this area and extend it to cover policy-iteration and function approximation methods (in addition to the value-iteration and tabular counterparts). We also identify and discuss opportunities for future work.",

Numerous studies confirm that customers' shopping behavior can highly be managed by many in-store factors such that retail managers try to systematically consider them in order to achieve a well-established solution for shelf-space allocation problem (SSAP). To assist them, we develop an approach based on two artificial intelligence techniques to facilitate well-designed shelf space management. We propose an iterative simulation-optimization approach that integrates customers' shopping path in the potential demand and introduces it by simulation in the optimization. A profit-based integer programming is also presented that the related computer program, being able to solve small-sized instances, applies important factors including shelf level utility, attraction of store' zones, allocated shelf space, number of product facings, and demand substitution effects. The problem is inherently a complex and large-sized problem; therefore, we develop two algorithms: GA and hybrid GA with imperialist competitive algorithm. The experimental results prove good performance of hybrid algorithm in terms of both the solution quality and computation time. By embedding this flexible and powerful framework in an expert tool, retail managers are capable of making effective decisions.",

            "title": "Commentary - Perspectives on Stochastic Optimization Over Time",
            "paperAbstract": "Motivated by the discussion in Powell (2010), I offer a few comments on the interactions and merging of stochastic optimization research in artificial intelligence (AI) and operations research (OR), a process that has been ongoing for more than a decade. In a broad sense, decision making over time and under uncertainty is a core subject in several fields that can perhaps be described collectively as the \u201cinformation and decision sciences,\u201d which includes operations research, systems and control theory, and artificial intelligence. These different fields and communities have much to offer to each other. Operations research and systems and control theory have been close for a long time. In both fields, the predominant description of uncertainty involves probabilistic models, and the goal is usually one of optimizing an objective function subject to constraints. Any differences between these two fields are due to \u201cculture\u201d (different departments and conferences), motivating applications (physics-based versus service-oriented systems), and technical taste (e.g., discrete versus continuous state and time), and yet the legacy of Bellman is equally strong on both sides. AI is a little different. Originally driven by the lofty goal of understanding and reproducing \u201cintelligence,\u201d AI involves an eclectic mix of logic, discrete mathematics, heuristics, and computation, with a focus on problems too complex to be amenable to mainstream methods such as linear or dynamic programming. Today, however, there is a notable convergence of the \u201cmodern approach\u201d to AI (as exemplified by Russell and Norvig 1995) and the more traditional methodologies of applied mathematics. Quite often, the clever heuristic approaches developed in AI to deal with complex problems are best understood, and then enhanced, by deploying suitably adapted classical tools. Decision making over time and under uncertainty is a prominent example of such convergence: indeed, the methods of \u201creinforcement learning\u201d are best understood as methods of approximate dynamic programming (ADP). This connection is certainly intellectually satisfying. More important, this connection is valuable because insights and approaches developed in one field or community can (and have been) transferred to another. A central idea connecting the two fields is the \u201cheuristic evaluation function,\u201d initially introduced in AI game-playing programs. The ideal evaluation function, leading to optimal play, is nothing but Bellman\u2019s optimal value function, in principle computable by dynamic programming (DP) algorithms and their extensions to the context of Markov games. For difficult problems where the optimal value function is practically impossible to compute, value function approximations become useful, potentially leading to near-optimal performance. Such approximations can be developed in an ad hoc manner or through suitable approximate dynamic programming methods. The latter approach has opened up a vast range of possibilities and an active research area. Having identified the common foundation, it is worth elaborating on some differences of emphasis in the different communities. One key distinction concerns \u201conline\u201d and \u201coffline\u201d methods. Reinforcement learning has been motivated in terms of agents that act over time, observe the consequences of their decisions, and try to improve their decision-making rule (or \u201cpolicy,\u201d in DP language) on the basis of accumulated experience. (As such, reinforcement learning is also closely related to the problem of adaptive control in systems and control theory.) A typical example is provided by a poorly modeled robot operating in a poorly modeled environment that \u201clearns\u201d online and incrementally improves its policy and performance. Learning online is unavoidable in \u201cmodel-free\u201d problems, where an analytical or simulation model is absent. On the other hand, most operations research applications of ADP are not of the online or model-free",

            "paperAbstract": "Road traffic environments are highly dynamic and volatile with a multitude of roadside and external environmental factors contributing to its dynamicity. Apart from infrastructure-related means such as traffic lights, planned and unplanned road events and different road networks, a core component which contributes towards the traffic environment is the human factor which is heavily overlooked in the current studies. Due to diverse travel patterns of day-to-day activities, the commuter behaviour is directly depicted in traffic patterns providing an opportunity to further explore human behaviours using road traffic. Conducting such analysis would reveal different commuter behavioural patterns that can be used for optimization and timely management of operations. However, to conduct such real-time behaviour analysis, large volumes of high-frequency data are required with high granularity, as well as, a suitable technology to manage such data. Addressing these needs, we propose an environment-driven commuter behavioural model that can be used to elucidate diverse behaviours in road traffic environments. We conceptualized, designed and developed an artificial intelligence based commuter behaviour profiling framework to detect diverse commuter behavioural profiles, fluctuating and routine patterns among commuters using traffic flow profiling and travel trajectory analysis. We evaluated the framework using 190 million data points captured from the Bluetooth sensor network of the Melbourne arterial road network, in the state of Victoria in Australia. The results demonstrate that traffic flow profiling of the proposed framework can provide insights on recurrent commuter behaviours that are distinct to a selected area with a high granularity. Moreover, traffic trajectory analysis provides insights on non-recurrent behaviours such as accidents with regard to how such incidents impact the dynamics of the network and how the impact is propagated through the network. Besides road traffic management, the proposed framework will enable real-time decision-making when planning road infrastructure and support decision-making of government and business entities to optimize operations.",

Objectives: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as disruptive technologies with the potential to drastically affect clinical decision making in spine surgery. AI can enhance the delivery of spine care in several arenas: (1) preoperative patient workup, patient selection, and outcome prediction; (2) quality and reproducibility of spine research; (3) perioperative surgical assistance and data tracking optimization; and (4) intraoperative surgical performance. The purpose of this narrative review is to concisely assemble, analyze, and discuss current trends and applications of AI and ML in conventional and robotic-assisted spine surgery. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive PubMed search of peer-reviewed articles that were published between 2006 and 2019 examining AI, ML, and robotics in spine surgery. Key findings were then compiled and summarized in this review. Results: The majority of the published AI literature in spine surgery has focused on predictive analytics and supervised image recognition for radiographic diagnosis. Several investigators have studied the use of AI/ML in the perioperative setting in small patient cohorts; pivotal trials are still pending. Conclusions: Artificial intelligence has tremendous potential in revolutionizing comprehensive spine care. Evidence-based, predictive analytics can help surgeons improve preoperative patient selection, surgical indications, and individualized postoperative care. Robotic-assisted surgery, while still in early stages of development, has the potential to reduce surgeon fatigue and improve technical precision.",

The criteria for which task is \u201cbest\u201d can be derived by performance metrics as well as the ability for it to satisfy all constraints upon the robot and its mission. Constraints may exist based on safety, reliability, accuracy, etc. This paper presents a decision framework capable of assisting a robotic system to select a task that satisfies all constraints as well as is optimized based upon one or more performance criteria. The framework models this decision process as a constraint satisfaction problem using techniques and algorithms from constraint programming and constraint optimization in order to provide a solution in real-time. This paper presents this framework and initial results provided through two demonstrations. The first utilizes simulation to provide an initial proof of concept, and the second, a security robot demonstration, is performed using a physical robot.",

            "paperAbstract": "Multimorbidity refers to the coexistence of two or more chronic diseases in one person. Therefore, patients with multimorbidity have multiple and special care needs. However, in practice it is difficult to meet these needs because the organizational processes of current healthcare systems tend to be tailored to a single disease. To improve clinical decision making and patient care in multimorbidity, a radical change in the problem-solving approach to medical research and treatment is needed. In addition to the traditional reductionist approach, we propose interactive research supported by artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced big data analytics. Such research approach, when applied to data routinely collected in healthcare settings, provides an integrated platform for research tasks related to multimorbidity. This may include, for example, prediction, correlation, and classification problems based on multiple interaction factors. However, to realize the idea of this paradigm shift in multimorbidity research, the optimization, standardization, and most importantly, the integration of electronic health data into a common national and international research infrastructure is needed. Ultimately, there is a need for the integration and implementation of efficient AI approaches, particularly deep learning, into clinical routine directly within the workflows of the medical professionals.",

These two approaches are used to solve real-parameter., bound constrained multi-objective optimization problems. The proposed multi-objective variants are based on a decomposition approach., where a multi-objective optimization problem is transformed into a number of scalar optimization sub-problems which are simultaneously optimized. The proposed algorithms are tested on seven unconstrained test problems proposed for the special session and competition on multi-objective optimizers held at the 2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation as well as on five classical bi-objective test in-stances. The proposed approaches are compared with two de-composition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms which are representative of the state-of-the-art in the area. Our results indicate that the proposed approaches obtain highly competitive results in most of the test instances.",

With the rapid development of wireless communication and networking technologies, novel information services and applications are booming globally. Advanced communications and networks greatly enhance users\u2019 experience and have had a significant impact on all aspects of people\u2019s lives, including at home, at work, in social exchanges, and economically. Although these advanced techniques have extensively improved users\u2019 quality of experience (QoE), they are not adequate to meet the various requirements of seamless wide area coverage, high-capacity hotspot, low-power massive connections, low latency and high reliability, and other scenarios. Under the new service paradigm, artificial intelligence (AI) is significant for cognitive wireless communications to meet various technical challenges. The application potential includes complicated decision making, wireless network management, resource optimization, and in-depth knowledge discovery in complex wireless networking environments.

In fact, the group decision making convergence is always a dynamic process. The preferences of decision maker are dynamic changing in this process, it is more realistic to apply the dynamic model to consider the consistence convergence process. This article defines the consistence convergence coeffiecient according to the difference between the average order of decision evaluation matrix and total order. And it proposes an inertia particle swarm optimization model to discuss the influence of knowledge transfer to group decision consistence, specifically to analyze the convergence process. The model applies bionics principle to describe and compute the knowledge transfer and perference convergence process in group decision. Then we discuss and analyze the decision consistence convergence rate and the reason on the study case that decision making individual has the innate knowledge and knowledge transfer in group. In addition, the inertia Pso model proposed in this article is reasonable and effective in solving the project choice plan, and it will provide the basis for consistence convergence analysis in dynamic group decision making.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract Context The practice of using Unified Modeling Language models during software development and the chances of occurrence of model inconsistencies during software design are increasing. Hence detection of intra-model design inconsistencies is significant in the development of quality software. Objective The existing approaches of detecting class attribute inconsistencies rely on human decision making. Manual detection of inconsistencies is exhaustive, time consuming and sometimes incomplete. Therefore, we propose an automated and novel approach to perform consistency check of class attributes using artificial intelligence. Method Inconsistency in attribute definition and specification is detected and fixed with self regulating particle swarm optimization (SRPSO) algorithm that uses a fitness function to optimize the consistency of attributes in class diagram and activity diagrams. SRPSO is preferred since the best particle is not influenced by its or others experience and uses its direction as the best direction and the remaining particles use self and social knowledge to update their velocity and position. Result The use of artificial intelligence technique for detection and fixing of inconsistencies during the software design phase ensures design completeness through generation of models with consistent attribute definitions and a significant improvement in software quality prediction, accurate code generation, meeting time deadlines, and software production and maintenance cost is achieved. Conclusion Ensuring consistency and completeness of models is an inevitable aspect in software design and development. The proposed approach automates the process of inconsistency detection and correction in class attribute definition and specification using SRPSO algorithm during the design phase of software development.",

It is supposed that some external events sensed in real time are susceptible to give relevant information about data. BN consists in graphical representation of probabilistic relationship between variables of a knowledge system and so permit to take into account uncertainty in an expert system by bringing together the classical artificial intelligence (AI) approach and statistics approach. They will be used to estimate numerical values of parameters subjected to the influence of random events for a linear programming program that perform optimization process in order to select optimal values of decision variables of a certain real time decision-making system.",

            "paperAbstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) heralds a step-change in wireless networks but may also cause irreversible environmental damage due to its high energy consumption. Here, we address this challenge in the context of 5G and beyond, where there is a complexity explosion in radio resource management (RRM). For high-dimensional RRM problems in a dynamic environment, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides a powerful tool for scalable optimization, but it consumes a large amount of energy over time and risks compromising progress made in green radio research. This article reviews and analyzes how to achieve green DRL for RRM via both architecture and algorithm innovations. Architecturally, a cloudbased training and distributed decision-making DRL scheme is proposed, where RRM entities can make lightweight, deep, local decisions while being assisted by on-cloud training and updating. At the algorithm level, compression approaches are introduced for both deep neural networks (DNNs) and the underlying Markov decision processes (MDPs), enabling accurate lowdimensional representations of challenges. To scale learning across geographic areas, a spatial transfer learning scheme is proposed to further promote the learning efficiency of distributed DRL entities by exploiting the traffic demand correlations. Together, our proposed architecture and algorithms provide a vision for green and on-demand DRL capability.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract Two approaches have traditionally been identified for developing artificial intelligence systems supporting decision-making: Machine Learning, which applies general techniques based on statistical analysis and optimization methods to extract information from a large amount of data looking for possible relations among them, and Expert Systems, which codify experts knowledge in rules, which are then applied to a specific situation. One of the main advantages of the first approach is its greater accuracy and wider generality for the application of the methods developed which can be used in various scenarios. By contrast, expert systems are usually more restricted and often applicable only to the domain for which they were originally developed. However, the machine learning approach requires the availability of large chunks of data, and it is much more complicated to interpret the results of the statistical methods to obtain some explanation of why the system decides, classifies, or evaluates a situation in a certain way. This issue may become very important in areas such as medicine, where it is relevant to know why the system recommends a certain treatment or diagnoses a certain illness. Likewise, in the financial sector, it might be legally required to explain that a decision to reject the granting of a mortgage loan to a person is not due to discriminatory causes such as gender or race. In order to be able to have interpretability and extract knowledge of available data we developed a classification method based on Dempster-Shafer\u2019s Plausibility Theory. Mass assignment functions (MAF) must be established to apply this theory and they assign a weight or probability to all subsets of the possible outcomes, given the presence of a certain fact on a decision scenario. Thus MAF assignments encode expert knowledge. The method learns optimal values for the weights of each MAF using the Gradient Descent method. The presented method allows combination of MAF which have been generated by the method itself or defined by an expert with those that are derived from a set of available data. The developed method was first applied to controlled scenarios and traditional data sets to ensure that classifications and explanations are correct. Results show that the model can classify with an accuracy which is comparable to other statistical classification methods, being also able to extract the most important decision rules from the data.",

The paper introduces the decision making model which is based on the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Essentially the business spatial data illustrate the group behaviors. The swarm optimization, which is highly influenced by the behavior of creature, performs in group. The Spatial data is defined as data that is represented by 2D or 3D images. SQL Server supports only 2D images till now. As we know that location is an essential part of any organizational data as well as business data: enterprises maintain customer address lists, own property, ship goods from and to warehouses, manage transport flows among their workforce, and perform many other activities. By means to say a lot of spatial data is used and processed by enterprises, organizations and other bodies in order to make the things more visible and selfdescriptive. From the experiments, we found that PSO is can facilitate the intelligence in social and business behaviour.",

            "paperAbstract": "Task allocation in multiple agent system has been widely applied many application fields, such as unmanned aerial vehicle, multi-robot system and manufacturing system et al. Therefore, it becomes one of the hot topics in distributed artificial intelligence research field for several years. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel task allocation algorithm in multiple agent systems utilizing ant colony optimization. Firstly, the basic structure of agent organization is described, which include context-aware module, information processing module, the executing module, decision-making and intelligent control module, knowledge base and task table. Based the above agent structure, these module utilize the knowledge in the external environment to process the information in agent communicating. Secondly, we point out that task allocation process in multiple agent systems can be implement by creating the space to the mapping of the multi-agent organization. Thirdly, a modified multiple agent system oriented ant colony optimization algorithm is given, which contain pre-processing steps and the task allocation results are obtained by executing the trust region sqp algorithm in local solver. Finally, performance evaluation is conducted by experiments comparing with Random strategy and Instant optimal strategy, and very positive results are obtained",

To explore opportunities and evaluate the performance of these machine learning techniques, various benchmark suites are available, such as the Arcade Learning Environment, rllab, OpenAI Gym, and the StarCraft II Learning Environment. This set of benchmark suites is extended with the open business simulation model described here, which helps to promote the use of machine learning techniques as valueadding tools in the context of strategic decision making and economic model calibration and harmonization. The benchmark suite extends the current state-of-the-art problems for deep-reinforcement learning by offering an infinite state and action space for multiple players in a non-zero-sum game environment of imperfect information. It provides a model that can be characterized as both a credit assignment problem and an optimization problem. Experiments with this suite?s deep-reinforcement learning algorithms, which yield remarkable results for various artificial games, highlight that stylized market behavior can be replicated, but the infinite action space, simultaneous decision making, and imperfect information pose a computational challenge. With the directions provided, the benchmark suite can be used to explore new solutions in machine learning for strategic decision making and model calibration.",

The training results cannot be evaluated intelligently and accurately, and the performance of dynamic analysis is poor. To address this problem, the core training system of strength quality of aerobics special movements based on artificial intelligence is designed to realize the intelligent training of the strength quality of aerobics special movements. Through the study of fuzzy paradigm system, intelligent functions such as optimization and decision-making of intelligent fuzzy network are realized. The design system architecture framework includes the modules of sensor, receiver, database, and analysis decision. The core chip of the system is the main control module of Atmega1280 MCU for man-machine interaction, so as to realize the comprehensive training of the strength quality of aerobics special movements. Information collection module is used to collect information on strength training information such as instrument, movement, and language. The problem of phase distortion in signal transmission process is processed by FIR filter. Through information management module, trainee information management and training results statistics and queries are implemented. In the system software part, the system software structure diagram and system startup and landing procedure are given. By analyzing the working process of the module, the strength of aerobics special movements is analyzed. Experimental results show that the designed system can achieve real-time and stable strength training for aerobics special movements and improve training efficiency.",

The following is an examination of several applications in which type 1 and 2 fuzzy logic has been utilized in artificial intelligence and machine learning problems to demonstrate their capabilities. In Fuzzy Logic Inferencing for PONG (FLIP), the effectiveness of type 1 logic is examined as an optimal controller for players in the game of PONG. Robotic collaboration is also developed as the PONG game was expanded into a multiplayer option. Collaborative Learning using Fuzzy Inferencing (CLIFF) is an extension of this PONG game, however type-2 logic is used to create a robotic coach that optimizes its players to beat its opponent in a development of layered fuzzy learning. Precision Route Optimization using Fuzzy Intelligence (PROFIT) examines the use of fuzzy logic as an optimizer in an algorithmic solution to a modified Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is modified in a way to better mimic a real-life scenario where footprints must be visited instead of simply points, which gives an interesting complexity to the problem. Considering the successes associated with these research endeavors, it can be concluded that type 1 and 2 fuzzy logic are both interesting tools that can further the abilities of intelligent systems and machine learning algorithms.",

Notably, the importance of the ABC algorithm is increasing after artificial intelligence, and automatic decision-making techniques are popularized in almost every field. The analysis of images obtained from medical imaging devices attracts the attention of artificial intelligence researchers because of the importance of these images for human health. Although the ABC algorithm is very humid for medical image analysis, there is no comprehensive literature review of medical image analysis techniques. This study includes a comprehensive survey of academic studies including classification, enhancement, clustering, and segmentation of medical images using ABC. The academic studies between the years 2010-2020 are examined, and 95 studies are presented in total. 42 of these studies consist of medical image analysis studies. Of the selected studies, 20 studies are related to image classification, 15 studies are related to image enhancement, 18 academic studies are related to image clustering, and 42 studies are related to image segmentation methods. The findings of this study show that the ABC method for medical image analysis has positive effects on classification, segmentation, clustering, and enhancement methods, and the use of the ABC method has become more common. We hope that this study will help new researchers to use the ABC method.",

            "paperAbstract": "The rapid development of artificial intelligence in multiple scenarios, including machine learning, image recognition, and autonomous driving, has led to an explosion of computation jobs. These jobs are often divided into parallel child tasks and executed in distributed clusters with limited computing resources, making parallel task scheduling one of the most important research topics nowadays. Most studies about parallel task scheduling focused on formulating special scenarios and service requirements as optimization problems. However, the complicated and dynamic parallel computing environments are hard to model, predict and control, making those previous methods unscalable and unable to reflect the real scenarios. In this paper, a Multi-task Deep reinforcement learning approach for scalable parallel Task Scheduling (MDTS) is firstly devised. Generally, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a model-free optimization algorithm for long-term control by leveraging experience, but it suffers the curse of dimensionality for decision when coping with complex parallel computing environments and jobs with diverse properties. We extend the action selection in DRL to a multi-task decision, where the output branches of multitask learning are fine-matched to parallel scheduling tasks. Child tasks of a job are accordingly assigned to distributed nodes without any human knowledge while the resource competition among parallel tasks is leveraged through shared neural network layers. Extensive experiments show that the MDTS significantly reduces the job execution time compared with least-connection scheduling and particle swarm optimization algorithm by 15.3% and 39.8% respectively. Moreover, MDTS outperforms the raw DRL algorithm on job execution time, load imbalance value, and total cost by 42.8%, 47.5%, and 59.0%.",

Modern irrigation systems are equipped with smart tools manufactured and controlled by human intelligence. The proposed CSO algorithm is inspired from the functioning of water distribution tools to model search agents for carrying out the optimization process. CSO imitates the mechanism of projection of water units by sprinklers and the movements of their platforms to the desired locations for scheming optimum searching procedures. The proposed method has been tested using a number of diverse natured benchmark functions with low and high dimensions. Statistical analysis of the empirical data demonstrates that CSO offers solutions of better quality in comparison with several well-practiced algorithms like genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE), artificial bee colony (ABC), covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), teaching and learning based optimization (TLBO) and water cycle algorithm (WCA). The experiments on high-dimensional problems reveal that CSO algorithm also outperforms significantly a number of algorithms designed specifically for high dimensional global optimization problems.",

This paper focuses on developing a teaming requirements elicitation process using AI and Blockchain technologies under the democratic knowledge management perspective. AI will be primarily addressed via Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Expert Systems and Fuzzy Logic, but also through the integration of cognitive sciences that can contribute effectively on the selection of team members in team building. Furthermore, Blockchain maximizes the company\u2019s potential through personnel growth and diversity by supplementing AI on understanding deeper the capacity and competence teams have on responding to changes through continuous learning from each experience. This integration of AI and Blockchain in corporate teaming will be driven through the Company Democracy Model as the base framework for co-evolutionary processes development allowing an essential mutation from autocratic to liberal democratic leadership, and from skill-based to knowledge-based human capitalization.",

Today, by the ubiquitous wireless connectivity, the boost of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and the advances in big data analytics, it is safe to say that IoT has evolved to a new concept called the Internet of Everything (IoE) or the Internet of All. IoE has four pillars, things, human, data, and processes, which render it as an inhomogeneous large-scale network. A crucial challenge of such a network is to develop management, analysis, and optimization policies that besides utility-maximizer machines, also take irrational humans into account. We discuss several networking applications in which appropriate modeling of human decision-making is vital. We then provide a brief review of computational models of human decision-making. Based on one such model, we develop a solution for a task offloading problem in fog computing and we analyze the implications of including humans in the loop.",

Here, using neuronal cultures, we demonstrate that increased training frequency accelerates the neuronal adaptation processes. This mechanism was implemented on artificial neural networks, where a local learning step-size increases for coherent consecutive learning steps, and tested on a simple dataset of handwritten digits, MNIST. Based on our on-line learning results with a few handwriting examples, success rates for brain-inspired algorithms substantially outperform the commonly used ML algorithms. We speculate this emerging bridge from slow brain function to ML will promote ultrafast decision making under limited examples, which is the reality in many aspects of human activity, robotic control, and network optimization.",

            "paperAbstract": "Massive changes in electricity markets have occurred during the last years, as a consequence of the massive introduction of renewable energies. These changes have led to a restructuring process that had an impact throughout the electrical industry. The case of the electricity markets is a relevant example, where new forms of trading emerged and new market entities were created. With these changes, the complexity of electricity markets increased as well, which brought out the need from the involved players for adequate support to their decision making process. Artificial intelligence plays an important role in the development of these tools. Multi-agent systems, in particular, have been largely explored by stakeholders in the sector. Artificial intelligence also provides intelligent solutions for optimization, which enable troubleshooting in a short time and with very similar results to those achieved by deterministic techniques, which usually result from very high execution times. The work presented in this paper aims at solving a portfolio optimization problem for electricity markets participation, using an approach based on NPSO-LRS (New Particle Swarm Optimization with Local Random Search). The proposed method is used to assist decisions of electricity market players.",

The limitations of existing analytical, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) based approaches are highlighted and a novel integration of random neural network (RNN) based learning with genetic algorithm (GA) based reasoning is presented. In first part of the implementation, three learning algorithms (gradient descent (GD), adaptive inertia weight particle swarm optimization (AIWPSO), and differential evolution (DE)) are applied to RNN and two learning algorithms (GD and levenberg-marquardt (LM)) are applied to artificial neural network (ANN). In second part of the implementation, the GA based reasoning is applied to the trained ANN and RNN models for performance optimization. Finally, the ANN and RNN based optimization results are compared with the state-of-the-art fractional power control (FPC) schemes in terms of user throughput and power consumption. The simulation results have revealed that an RNN-DE (RNN trained with DE algorithm) based cognitive engine (CE) can provide up to 14% more cell capacity along with 6dBm and 9dBm less user power consumption as compared to RNN-GD (RNN trained with GD algorithm) and FPC methods respectively.",

            "paperAbstract": "The operating mechanism of the biological immune system is often used for the development of intelligent technology. This research introduces the multi-functional optimization algorithm of the biological immune system into the VR image segmentation, and proposes a multi-purpose VR image segmentation method with more stable and better segmentation performance. In order to combine it with the characteristics of the VR image itself, a complementary feature extraction method combining filters and gray-level symbiosis probability is used. In addition, in order to enable the algorithm to solve the segmentation problem of huge pixel images, the best solution is found through communication and exchange between subgroups. Use the excellent genes of the memory genes as the imported genes and introduce the inferior individuals to strengthen the mining of the best solution of Pareto at the boundary of the impossible field. In order to verify the performance of the algorithm, 3 synthetic texture images and 2 actual VR images are used, 8 constrained targets and 4 unconstrained target benchmark functions are selected to test the optimization function of PCMIOA. Multipoint parallel search uses two different search schemes, local and global. In this way, the domain value of the highest value can be searched globally, and the local best solution can be searched at the same time, realizing the global search mechanism. The relatively satisfactory target value is 98.25, and the deviation between the corresponding solution and the ideal solution is 0.093. The results of the research show that Multi - objective optimization algorithm is an excellent demonstration of the diversity of Pareto-oriented methods and solutions. Compared with the previous prediction methods, this method has higher prediction accuracy and robustness. The choice of decision makers can be taken into consideration, and subjective willfulness can be reduced to make decision results more realistic and reliable.",

Many researchers have successfully shown the \u2018thought process\u2019 behind a network\u2019s decision making. This rich and interesting information has not been utilized beyond the scope of visualizations once the training finish. In this work, a novel idea to utilize this insight to the network as a training parameter is proposed. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), which obtains the effect of each neuron towards the output of the whole network, is used as a parameter, along with learning rate and network weights, to optimize the training. Various intuitive formulations have been proposed, and the results of the experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets have been reported in this paper. Our proposed methodologies show better or comparable performances against conventional optimization algorithms. This would open a new dimension of research to explore the possibility of using XAI in optimizing the training of neural networks.",

The exploration of such huge quantities of data needs more efficient methods with high analysis accuracy. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning and evolutionary algorithms able to provide more precise, faster, and scalable outcomes in big data analytics. Despite this interest, as far as we are aware there is not any complete survey of various artificial intelligence techniques for big data analytics. The present survey aims to study the research done on big data analytics using artificial intelligence techniques. The authors select related research papers using the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method. Four groups are considered to investigate these mechanisms which are machine learning, knowledge-based and reasoning methods, decision-making algorithms, and search methods and optimization theory. A number of articles are investigated within each category. Furthermore, this survey denotes the strengths and weaknesses of the selected AI-driven big data analytics techniques and discusses the related parameters, comparing them in terms of scalability, efficiency, precision, and privacy. Furthermore, a number of important areas are provided to enhance the big data analytics mechanisms in the future.",

            "paperAbstract": "Because combat environments change over time and technology upgrades are widespread for ground vehicles, a large number of vehicles and equipment become quickly obsolete. A possible solution for the U.S. Army is to develop fleets of modular military vehicles, which are built by interchangeable substantial components also known as modules. One of the typical characteristics of module is their ease of assembly and disassembly through simple means such as plug-in/pull-out actions, which allows for real-time fleet reconfiguration to meet dynamic demands. Moreover, military demands are time-varying and highly stochastic because commanders keep reacting to enemy's actions. To capture these characteristics, we formulated an intelligent agent-based model to imitate decision making process during fleet operation, which combines real-time optimization with artificial intelligence. The agents are capable of inferring enemy's future move based on historical data and optimize dispatch/operation decisions accordingly. We implement our model to simulate an attacker-defender game between two adversarial and intelligent players, representing the commanders from modularized fleet and conventional fleet respectively. Given the same level of combat resources and intelligence, we highlight the tactical advantages of fleet modularity in terms of win rate, unpredictability and suffered damage.",

Experimental work has been carried out for measuring the thrust force for five different commonly used alloys, under several cutting conditions. An artificial neural network-based model was implemented for modelling the thrust force. Neural model showed a high goodness of fit and appropriate generalization capability. The optimization process was executed by considered two different and conflicting objectives: the unit machining time and the thrust force (based on the previously obtained model). A multiobjective genetic algorithm was used for solving the optimization problem and a set of non-dominated solutions was obtained. The Pareto's front representation was depicted and used for assisting the decision making process.",

            "paperAbstract": "\n Abstract\n \n Our work has been carried out with the aim of providing a solution to decision-making problems encountered in information systems for supply chains in crisis situation. The supply chain represents a competitive advantage that companies seek to perpetuate. It aims to optimize the exchanges, or flows, that the company maintains with its suppliers and its customers. These flows can be of various natures. It can be information flows relating to supplies or product design, financial flows linked to purchases, or even flows of goods. The crisis management logistics is getting more and more attention, especially in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic. For these systems, where it is never very easy to anticipate the evolution of the environment, the forms of changes undergone are varied and rapid. We aim to provide an answer to these challenges, in an approach that links optimization methods to the paradigm of artificial intelligence. We therefore propose to find mathematical models, and inter-agent cooperation protocols, to minimize the risk of stock shortage in any area of \u200b\u200bthe supply chain.\n \n",

The sand making machine is chosen as an empirical example because it is the main equipment for the mining machinery. However, product designers only pay attention to its structure and/or functions when they design it. Consequently, the design decision support system built in this paper can be an important reference for product designers\u2019 work, which can examine the design optimization on product elements and help them do the best choice as they design a new vehicle product. The result shows that the NN technique is promising to help product designers design a new sand making machine that best meets specific needs.",

Meanwhile artificial intelligence is introduced in Nuclear Imaging. This review will give an overview of recent technical and clinical developments and an outlook on application of these in the near future.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nDigital PET/CT has shown gradual improvement in lesion detection and demarcation over conventional PET/CT, but total-body PET/CT holds promise for a magnitude of improvement in scan duration and quality, quantification, and dose optimization. PET-guided decision-making with the application of PSMA-ligands has been shown useful in demonstrating and biopting primary prostate cancer (PCa) lesions, guiding radiotherapy, guiding surgical resection of recurrent PCa, and assessing therapy response in PCa. Artificial intelligence made its way into Nuclear Imaging just recently, but encouraging progress promises clinical application with unprecedented possibilities.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nEvidence is growing on clinical usefulness of PET-guided decision-making with the still relatively new PSMA ligands as a prime example. Rapid evolution of PET instrumentation and clinical introduction of artificial intelligence will be the gamechangers of nuclear imaging in the near future, though its powers should still be mastered and incorporated in clinical practice.",

            "paperAbstract": "What is the nature of curiosity? Is there any scientific way to understand the origin of this mysterious force that drives the behavior of even the stupidest naturally intelligent systems and is completely absent in their smartest artificial analogs? Can we build AI systems that could be curious about something, systems that would have an intrinsic motivation to learn? Is such a motivation quantifiable? Is it implementable? I will discuss this problem from the standpoint of physics. The relationship between physics and intelligence is a consequence of the fact that correctly predicted information is nothing but an energy resource, and the process of thinking can be viewed as a process of accumulating and spending this resource through the acts of perception and, respectively, decision making. The natural motivation of any autonomous system to keep this accumulation/spending balance as high as possible allows one to treat the problem of describing the dynamics of thinking processes as a resource optimization problem. Here I will propose and discuss a simple theoretical model of such an autonomous system which I call the Autonomous Turing Machine (ATM). The potential attractiveness of ATM lies in the fact that it is the model of a self-propelled AI for which the only available energy resource is the information itself. For ATM, the problem of optimal thinking, learning, and decision-making becomes conceptually simple and mathematically well tractable. This circumstance makes the ATM an ideal playground for studying the dynamics of intelligent behavior and allows one to quantify many seemingly unquantifiable features of genuine intelligence.",

Recently, an enforced trend towards the integration of different techniques has been initiated. Hybrid approaches, in which different decision making agents cooperate for solving one decision model are investigated. This article proposes a procedural framework for setting up distributed decision making algorithms using two or even more decision making agents. We propose generic procedures for a hybrid distributed decision making. As an example, we describe a matheuristic, which combines a metaheuristic with an analytical optimization algorithm for solving a multiple constrained decision making model of a decision problem from logistics.",

Feeding such analytics to a suitably trained collection of machine learning algorithms called the \u201cDigital Operations Manager\u201d helps to automate complex decision making, removing human error and bias.

Eight papers were received; five following an open call for papers, and three in response to targeted invitations to authors to submit an extended version of their accepted papers to the fifth Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering (AIRE\u201918) workshop. The articles have undergone rigorous peer-review according to the journal\u2019s high standards, following which two papers were accepted. The twoarticles that comprise this special issue contain a common threadof employing techniques from Artificial Intelligence, such as algorithms or natural language processing, to automate the identification of aspects relevant to a requirements engineer. They are briefly discussed as follows:",

It is also the basis for extending the constraint satisfaction paradigm of Artificial Intelligence to accommodating flexible or prioritized constraints. This paper surveys refinements of the ordering of solutions supplied by the max\u2013min formulation, namely the discrimin partial ordering and the leximin complete preordering. A general algorithm is given which computes all maximal solutions in the sense of these relations. It also sheds light on the structure of the set of best solutions. Moreover, classes of problems for which there is a unique best discrimin and leximin solution are exhibited, namely, continuous problems with convex domains, and so called isotonic problems. Noticeable examples of such problems are fuzzy linear programming problems and fuzzy PERT-like scheduling problems.",

            "paperAbstract": "A crucial step for batch process improvement and optimization is to develop information structures that streamline data gathering and, above all, are capable of integrating transactional data into a system using the analytical tools that are developed. Current trends in electronics, computer science, artificial intelligence and control system technology are providing technical capability that greatly facilitates the development of multilevel decision-making support. In this paper, we present the batch process ontology (BaPrOn), wherein different concepts regarding batch processes are categorized and the relationships between them are examined and structured in accordance with ANSI/ISA-88 standards, which provide a solid and transparent framework for integrating batch-related information. This paper also focuses on systematic integration of different actors within the control process. The proposed approach bases the conceptualization through the ANSI/ISA-88 representation, providing the advantage of establishing a more general conceptualization of the batch process domain. The capabilities of the envisaged ontological framework were assessed in a test bed PROCEL pilot plant: scheduling-monitoring and control-rescheduling was closed, information quality was accessed by knowledge description, and an optimum decision-making task was performed. The ontological structure can be extended in the future to incorporate other hierarchical levels and their respective modeling knowledge.",

            "paperAbstract": "Throughout the years many have argued about different definitions for DSS; however they have all agreed that in order to succeed in the decision-making process, companies or individuals need to choose the right software that best fits their requirements and demands. The beginning of business software extends back to the early 1950s. Since the early 1970s, the decision support technologies became the most popular and they evolved most rapidly (Shim, Warkentin, Courtney, Power, Sharda, & Carlsson, 2002). With the existence of decision support systems came the creation of decision support software (DSS). Scientists and computer programmers applied analytical and scientific methods for the development of more sophisticated DSS. They used mathematical models and algorithms from such fields of study as artificial intelligence, mathematical simulation and optimization, and concepts of mathematical logic, and so forth. A DSS is an interactive computer-based system or subsystem intended to help decision makers use communications technologies, data, documents, knowledge and/or models to identify and solve problems, complete decision process tasks, and make decisions (Druzdzel & Flynn, 1999). The concept of decision support has evolved from two main areas of research: the theoretical studies of organizational decision making done at the Carnegie Institute of Technology during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and the technical work on interactive computer systems, mainly carried out at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1960s (Finlay, 1994). In the middle and late 1980s, executive information systems (EIS), group decision support software (GDSS), and organizational decision support software (ODSS) evolved from the single user and model-oriented DSS (Huber, 2006). background",

We assume that the firms place a given number of facilities on locations taken from a discrete set of possible points. For this bi-level optimization problem we consider six different customer behavior scenarios from the literature: binary, proportional and partially binary, each combined with essential and unessential demand. The decision making for the leader and the follower depends on these scenarios. In this work we present mixed integer linear programming models for the follower problem of each scenario and use them in combination with an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the location selection for the leader. A complete solution archive is used to detect already visited candidate solutions and convert them efficiently into similar, not yet considered ones. We present numerical results of our algorithm and compare them to so far state-of-the-art approaches from the literature. Our method shows good performance in all customer behavior scenarios and is able to outperform previous solution procedures on many occasions.",

            "paperAbstract": "The application of techniques from artificial intelligence, human decision-making processes, optimization, and learning methodologies have led to significant development in the field of cognitive radios. A cognitive radio improves on a traditional radio by incorporating situational awareness, learning, and decision-making to meet the application goals and adapt to the current operating environment. The field of cognitive radios is a very active, multi-disciplinary research area with significant benefits in many application areas. In this paper, we propose a \u201cmetacognitive engine\u201d, where a master process or controller that monitors and adapts the cognition process, generally called the \u201ccognitive engine\u201d. The metacognitive engine utilizes situational awareness and scenario classification and drives the cognitive process. By incorporating radio-level or system-level goals/missions and selecting the most suitable performance metric based on the mission and current state of the cognitive process, the metacognitive controller can adapt/modify the cognitive process to better utilize past experiences and achieve the best performance in the given operating environment. A case study where we apply the metacognitive radio to improve wireless communication systems used for signaling and train control in railroads is also presented.",

            "paperAbstract": "Game theory is a highly successful paradigm for strategic decision making between multiple agents having conflicting objectives. Since a few years, games have been studied in a computational perspective, raising new issues like complexity of equilibria or succinctness of representation. Indeed, the main representation for general games is still a n-dimensional matrix of exponential size called normal form. In this paper, we introduce the framework of Constraint Games to model strategic interaction between players. A Constraint Game is composed of a set of variables shared by all the players. Among these variables, each player owns a set of decision variables she can control and a Constraint Optimization Problem defining her preferences. Since the preferences of a player depend on the decisions taken by the other players, each player may try to improve her position by choosing an assignment that optimizes her preferences. Pure Nash equilibria are situations in which no player may improve her preferences unilaterally. Constraint Games are thus a generic tool to model general games and can be exponentially more succinct than their normal form. We show the practical utility of the framework by modelling a few realistic problems and we propose an algorithm based on tabu search to compute pure Nash equilibria in Constraint games that outperforms the algorithms based on normal form. In addition, Constraint Games raise some interesting research issues that deserve further attention.",

            "paperAbstract": "Electricity load forecasting has become one of the most functioning tools in energy efficiency and load management and utility companies which has been made very complex due to deregulation. Due to the importance of providing a secure and economic electricty for the consumers, having a reliable and robust enough forecast engine in short-term load management is very needful. Fuzzy inference system is one of primal branches of Artificial Intelligence techniques which has been widely used for different applications of decision making in complex systems. This paper aims to develop a Fuzzy inference system as a main forecast engine for Short term Load Forecasting (STLF) of a city in Iran. However, the optimization of this platform for this special case remains a basic problem. Hence, to address this issue, the Radial Movement Optimization (RMO) technique is proposed to optimize the whole Fuzzy platform. To support this idea, the accuracy of the proposed model is analyzed using MAPE index and an average error of 1.38% is obtained for the forecast load demand which represents the reliability of the proposed method. Finally, results achieved by this method, demonstrate that an adaptive two-stage hybrid system consisting of Fuzzy & RMO can be an accurate and robust enough choice for STLF problems.",

Optimization of mechatronic system control is provided by minimization of electric energy consumption and maximization of passengers\u2019 comfort level. We propose to solve this task using artificial intelligence and progressive multiple criteria decision making methods. The popular Nelder-Mead multiple criteria decision making method (Nelder and Mead 1965) is applied. This method makes it possible to find a minimal value for the target function. In this case there is a dependence of minimal electric energy consumption on maximal comfort level. Our modelling and investigation is based on a typical architecture of heating ventilation and air conditioning system with a traditional application of AC induction motors for driving both a compressor and a fan of the conditioner. Special interest and further development is devoted to intelligent heating systems, allowing more flexible regulation of the system\u2019s compressor and fan operation, and, therefore, improvement of efficiency and energy saving.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract The last decade witnessed tremendous developments in social media and e-democracy technologies. A fundamental aspect in these paradigms is that the number of decision makers allowed to partake in a decision making event drastically increases. As a result Large Scale Decision Making (LSDM) has established itself as an emerging and rapidly developing research field, attracting comprehensive studies in the last decade. LSDM events are a complex class of decision making problems, in which multiple and highly diverse stakeholders are involved and the provided alternatives are assessed considering multiple criteria/attributes. Since some of the extant LSDM research was extended from group decision making scenarios, there is no established definition for a LSDM problem as of yet. We firstly propose a clear definition and characterization of LSDM events as a basis for characterizing this emerging family of decision frameworks. Secondly, a classification of LSDM literature is provided. Effectively solving an LSDM problem is usually a complex and challenging process, in which reaching a high consensus or accounting for the agreement or conflict relationships between participants becomes critical. Accordingly, we present a taxonomy and an overview of LSDM models, predicated on their key elements, i.e. the procedures and specific steps followed by the existing models: consensus measurement, subgroup clustering, behavior management, and consensus building mechanisms. Finally, we provide a discussion in which we identify research challenges and propose future research directions under a triple perspective: key LSDM methodologies, AI and data fusion for LSDM, and innovative applications. The potential rise of AI-based LSDM is particularly highlighted in the discussion provided.",

            "paperAbstract": "Fueled by ever-growing amounts of (digital) data and advances in artificial intelligence, decision-making in contemporary societies is increasingly delegated to automated processes. Drawing from social science theories and from the emerging body of research about algorithmic appreciation and algorithmic perceptions, the current study explores the extent to which personal characteristics can be linked to perceptions of automated decision-making by AI, and the boundary conditions of these perceptions, namely the extent to which such perceptions differ across media, (public) health, and judicial contexts. Data from a scenario-based survey experiment with a national sample ( N \u2009=\u2009958) show that people are by and large concerned about risks and have mixed opinions about fairness and usefulness of automated decision-making at a societal level, with general attitudes influenced by individual characteristics. Interestingly, decisions taken automatically by AI were often evaluated on par or even better than human experts for specific decisions. Theoretical and societal implications about these findings are discussed.",

To a large extent, this is due to the fact that every patient is unique, and many symptoms and diagnoses are inherently imprecise and difficult to measure. A systematic decision-making and optimization technology capable of handling all the clinical difficulties is still unavailable despite significant efforts documented in the literature, including the use of artificial intelligence and statistical methods. One promising approach is the novel fuzzy discrete event systems whose theoretical framework was recently developed by us. We apply it to treatment planning for HIV/AIDS patients who have never received antiretroviral therapy. We show how to design such a system. We have also statistically evaluated the preliminary results produced by the system in comparison with two AIDS specialists on our team. The results indicate strong agreement between the physicians and the fuzzy discrete event system. This is the first application of fuzzy discrete event systems in the literature.",

            "paperAbstract": "The work being introduced is aimed at supporting the crucial activity of deciding what is to be done, and when, within an industrial, applied, real-world situation. More specifically, matching assorted tasks to applicable production units, and deciding the priority every job is to be given. The problem, common to many different industries, arises when a considerable amount of different articles must be produced on a relatively small number of reconfigurable units. Similar issues have a strong impact on an essential concern, eminently in the textile industrial domain: satisfying the always-in-a-rush customers, while keeping accessory production costs (set-up costs, machinery cleaning costs, ...) under control, keeping at a minimum the losses related to wasteful resource-management practices, due to under pressure decision making. Given the real-world situation, where human planners tend to be the only ones considered able to tackle such a problem, the innovation hereby suggested consists of an automated, artificial intelligence based, system capable of objectively driving the search and implementation of good solutions, without being influenced by pre-existing knowledge, mimicking a powerful lateral-thinking approach, so difficult to accomplish when management pressure impedes and daunting tasks bound the human rationality. Ranking the effectiveness of a candidate solution, where pathdependency and unexpected complex effects may bias the final outcome, is not a matter trivially manageable by traditional operational research-style systems where no dynamics (recursive phenomena, feedbacks, non-linearity) appear. In order to overcome the limitations that an analytical specification of the problem imposes, the Agent-Based Modelling paradigm had to be taken into consideration. Thanks to ABM we're provided with the opportunity of in-silico experimenting every imaginable scenario, by executing the planning in a virtual lab, where the production events happen instead of simplistically being computed. In this way, we avoid following a reductionist approach, clumsily based on the usage of a static representation of the enterprise world, squashed into a cumbersome system of equations. The model has been built resorting to the Swarm toolkit (see [Bur94], [JLS99], [MBLA96]); the underlying programming language (Objective-C) made the procedure of mapping the agents involved in the process onto software objects a plain and consistent task. The problem presented belongs to the shop problems family in general, although many peculiarities make it an unconventional and distinguished one. When referring to production planning, the authors have in mind the scheduling problem rather than ERP/MRP issues. In fact, the stage of the production on which the work is focused gives the availability of raw and semi-finished materials for granted. The up- and down-streams of the supply chain are normally performed by significantly oversized equipment, in the textile industry. On the other side, core processes, spinning and weaving in particular, require peak exploitation of the available production units.",

Multi\u2010sensor object recognition is one of the important technologies of MSDF. It has been widely applied in the fields of navigation, aviation, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, fuzzy control, robot, and so on. Hence, aimed at the type recognition problem in which the characteristic values of object types and observations of sensors are in the form of triangular fuzzy numbers, the purpose of this paper is to propose a new fusion method from the viewpoint of decision\u2010making theory.Design/methodology/approach \u2013 This work, first divides the comprehensive transaction process of sensor signal into two phases. Then, aimed at the type recognition problem, the paper gives the definition of similarity degree between two triangular fuzzy numbers. By solving the maximization optimization model, ...",

            "paperAbstract": "This paper introduces an effective computational environment for multi-objective decision-making, optimization and identification. The paper adopts multi-objective vector identification methodology and performance assessment provided by the parameter space investigation method (PSI). The main feature of this methodology is in the fact that various design objectives are taken into consideration in their natural form without reducing dimensionality of the problem and therefore without distorting its nature. Therefore, there is no need for artificial convolution and weighting of multiple criteria. Moreover, the design alternatives are assessed explicitly versus multiple given requirements. The main practical purpose of this work is of twofold. First, we introduce an optimization framework and technique that allows to determine feasible and Pareto sets of the numerous uncertainties inherent for real-world engineering systems. This framework tightly couples principal advantages of MatLab/Simulink simulation engine with the unique properties of the multi-objective PSI method. Second, we show key benefits of the MatLab/PSI bundle on the example of identification of the principal aerodynamic characteristics and apparent masses of the controllable circular parachute",

            "paperAbstract": "Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a method for making optimal decisions in artificial intelligence (AI) problems, typically move planning in combinatorial games. It combines the generality of random simulation with the precision of tree search. It can theoretically be applied to any domain that can be described in terms of state, action pairs and simulation used to forecast outcomes such as decision support, control, delayed reward problems or complex optimization. The motivation behind this work is caused by the emerging GPU-based systems and their high computational potential combined with relatively low power usage compared to CPUs. As a problem to be solved we chose to develop an AI GPU(Graphics Processing Unit)-based agent in the game of Reversi (Othello) which provides a sufficiently complex problem for tree searching with non-uniform structure and an average branching factor of over 8. We present an efficient parallel GPU MCTS implementation based on the introduced \u2019block-parallelism\u2019 scheme which combines GPU SIMD thread groups and performs independent searches without any need of intra-GPU or inter-GPU communication. We compare it with a simple leaf parallel scheme which implies certain performance limitations. The obtained results show that using my GPU MCTS implementation on the TSUBAME 2.0 system one GPU can be compared to 100-200 CPU threads depending on factors such as the search time and other MCTS parameters in terms of obtained results. We propose and analyze simultaneous CPU/GPU execution which improves the overall result.",

In addition to preventing failures, SHM extends aircraft life cycles. Consequently, adopting SHM is strongly motivated not only by flight safety but also by economic considerations. This article focuses on the optimization of aircraft usage as a new aspect of SHM and discusses a knowledge discovery approach based on dynamic time warping and genetic programming. In addition, it points out some of the challenges faced in applying artificial intelligence to aircraft SHM. This novel work reveals that AI provides a means to gain valuable knowledge for decision making on cost-efficient future usage of an aircraft fleet.",

            "paperAbstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) based cognitive solutions have widely been applied to deal with downlink inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) in long-term evolution (LTE) systems. This paper presents a random neural network (RNN) based novel framework to improve ICIC and radio resource management (RRM) in LTE-Uplink system. The RNN based cognitive engine (CE) is embedded within the eNodeB which allocates optimal radio parameters to attached users and also suggests acceptable transmit power to users served by adjacent cells, in order to reduce inter-cell interference (ICI). The proposed CE concurrently achieves long-term learning, fast decision making, and less computational complexity. These three CE design features are essential for the development and practical deployment of any real-time cognitive communication system and most of the existing AI/ML based cognitive solutions in literature lack them. The performance of RNN based optimization framework is compared with artificial neural network (ANN) and state-of-the-art fractional power control (FPC) scheme. In six different test-cases, simulation results have shown an improvement of 53.88%-87.53% in decision making accuracy and a decrease of 44.22% in scheduling delay as compared to ANN. In addition, throughput gain of 16.13% and 18.62% has been achieved as compared to ANN and FPC schemes respectively.",

Evolutionary computing is a subset from the artificial intelligence umbrella that involves continuous optimization and combinational optimization which is based on searching methodologies. It has also a lot of algorithms that have played a main role in supporting the decision making and taking processes accurately and effectively. It is concerning many fields in our life such as Industry, Agriculture, Engineering, Transportation, Medicine and Nutrition, etc. One of these algorithms is Genetic Algorithm (GA) which is contributed to a lot of fields. Moreover, Nutrition is a wide field of research because it has several sides, medically, physically and psychologically and so on. But, has Genetic Algorithms been used to contribute to the field of nutrition? This survey illustrates that (GA) is not involved in nutrition computerized models or applications and it suggests building a model to promote a nutrition system using this powerful algorithm and this study presents a suggestion to build a model for nutrition as a future work that uses Genetic Algorithm.",

            "paperAbstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been in existence for over six decades and has experienced AI winters and springs. The rise of super computing power and Big Data technologies appear to have empowered AI in recent years. The new generation of AI is rapidly expanding and has again become an attractive topic for research. This paper aims to identify the challenges associated with the use and impact of revitalised AI based systems for decision making and offer a set of research propositions for information systems (IS) researchers. The paper first provides a view of the history of AI through the relevant papers published in the International Journal of Information Management (IJIM). It then discusses AI for decision making in general and the specific issues regarding the interaction and integration of AI to support or replace human decision makers in particular. To advance research on the use of AI for decision making in the era of Big Data, the paper offers twelve research propositions for IS researchers in terms of conceptual and theoretical development, AI technology-human interaction, and AI implementation.",

            "title": "Diagnostic Efficacy and Therapeutic Decision-making Capacity of an Artificial Intelligence Platform for Childhood Cataracts in Eye Clinics: A Multicentre Randomized Controlled Trial",
            "paperAbstract": "Background CC-Cruiser is an artificial intelligence (AI) platform developed for diagnosing childhood cataracts and providing risk stratification and treatment recommendations. The high accuracy of CC-Cruiser was previously validated using specific datasets. The objective of this study was to compare the diagnostic efficacy and treatment decision-making capacity between CC-Cruiser and ophthalmologists in real-world clinical settings. Methods This multicentre randomized controlled trial was performed in five ophthalmic clinics in different areas across China. Pediatric patients (aged\u202f\u2264\u202f14\u202fyears) without a definitive diagnosis of cataracts or history of previous eye surgery were randomized (1:1) to receive a diagnosis and treatment recommendation from either CC-Cruiser or senior consultants (with over 5\u202fyears of clinical experience in pediatric ophthalmology). The experts who provided a gold standard diagnosis, and the investigators who performed slit-lamp photography and data analysis were blinded to the group assignments. The primary outcome was the diagnostic performance for childhood cataracts with reference to cataract experts' standards. The secondary outcomes included the evaluation of disease severity and treatment determination, the time required for the diagnosis, and patient satisfaction, which was determined by the mean rating. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03240848). Findings Between August 9, 2017 and May 25, 2018, 350 participants (700 eyes) were randomly assigned for diagnosis by CC-Cruiser (350 eyes) or senior consultants (350 eyes). The accuracies of cataract diagnosis and treatment determination were 87.4% and 70.8%, respectively, for CC-Cruiser, which were significantly lower than 99.1% and 96.7%, respectively, for senior consultants (p\u202f<\u202f0.001, OR\u202f=\u202f0.06 [95% CI 0.02 to 0.19]; and p\u202f<\u202f0.001, OR\u202f=\u202f0.08 [95% CI 0.03 to 0.25], respectively). The mean time for receiving a diagnosis from CC-Cruiser was 2.79\u202fmin, which was significantly less than 8.53\u202fmin for senior consultants (p\u202f<\u202f0.001, mean difference 5.74 [95% CI 5.43 to 6.05]). The patients were satisfied with the overall medical service quality provided by CC-Cruiser, typically with its time-saving feature in cataract diagnosis. Interpretation CC-Cruiser exhibited less accurate performance comparing to senior consultants in diagnosing childhood cataracts and making treatment decisions. However, the medical service provided by CC-Cruiser was less time-consuming and achieved a high level of patient satisfaction. CC-Cruiser has the capacity to assist human doctors in clinical practice in its current state.

This article identifies the idiosyncrasies of human and AI-based decision making along five key contingency factors: specificity of the decision search space, interpretability of the decision-making process and outcome, size of the alternative set, decision-making speed, and replicability. Based on a comparison of human and AI-based decision making along these dimensions, the article builds a novel framework outlining how both modes of decision making may be combined to optimally benefit the quality of organizational decision making. The framework presents three structural categories in which decisions of organizational members can be combined with AI-based decisions: full human to AI delegation; hybrid\u2014human-to-AI and AI-to-human\u2014sequential decision making; and aggregated human\u2013AI decision making.",

Of particular interest is practical implementation of such AI-based software as a cloud-based tool aimed for telemedicine, the practice of providing medical care from a distance using electronic interfaces. Methods: In this study, we used a dataset of labeled 35,900 optical coherence tomography (OCT) images obtained from age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients and used them to train three types of CNNs to perform AMD diagnosis. Results: Here, we present an AI- and cloud-based telemedicine interaction tool for diagnosis and proposed treatment of AMD. Through deep learning process based on the analysis of preprocessed optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging data, our AI-based system achieved the same image discrimination rate as that of retinal specialists in our hospital. The AI platform's detection accuracy was generally higher than 90% and was significantly superior (p < 0.001) to that of medical students (69.4% and 68.9%) and equal (p = 0.99) to that of retinal specialists (92.73% and 91.90%). Furthermore, it provided appropriate treatment recommendations comparable to those of retinal specialists. Conclusions: We therefore developed a website for realistic cloud computing based on this AI platform, available at https://www.ym.edu.tw/~AI-OCT/. Patients can upload their OCT images to the website to verify whether they have AMD and require treatment. Using an AI-based cloud service represents a real solution for medical imaging diagnostics and telemedicine.",

This review describes the weaknesses of traditional clinical decision-support systems and proposes that artificial intelligence should be used to augment surgical decision-making.\n\n\nObservations\nSurgical decision-making is dominated by hypothetical-deductive reasoning, individual judgment, and heuristics. These factors can lead to bias, error, and preventable harm. Traditional predictive analytics and clinical decision-support systems are intended to augment surgical decision-making, but their clinical utility is compromised by time-consuming manual data management and suboptimal accuracy. These challenges can be overcome by automated artificial intelligence models fed by livestreaming electronic health record data with mobile device outputs. This approach would require data standardization, advances in model interpretability, careful implementation and monitoring, attention to ethical challenges involving algorithm bias and accountability for errors, and preservation of bedside assessment and human intuition in the decision-making process.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nIntegration of artificial intelligence with surgical decision-making has the potential to transform care by augmenting the decision to operate, informed consent process, identification and mitigation of modifiable risk factors, decisions regarding postoperative management, and shared decisions regarding resource use.",

This offers great potential for synergy between AI systems and the human intellect already delivering care. This much needed help should be embraced, if proven effective. However, there is a risk that the present role of physicians and nurses as the primary arbiters of acute care in hospitals may be overtaken by computers. While many argue that this transition is inevitable, the process of developing a formal plan to prevent the need to pass control of patient care to computers should not be further delayed.The first step in the interdiction process is to recognize; the limitations of existing hospital protocols, why we need AI in acute care, and finally how the focus of medical decision making will change with the integration of AI based analysis. The second step is to develop a strategy for changing the focus of medical education to empower physicians to maintain oversight of AI. Physicians, nurses, and experts in the field of safe hospital communication must control the transition to AI integrated care because there is significant risk during the transition period and much of this risk is subtle, unique to the hospital environment, and outside the expertise of AI designers.AI is needed in acute care because AI detects complex relational time-series patterns within datasets and this level of analysis transcends conventional threshold based analysis applied in hospital protocols in use today. For this reason medical education will have to change to provide healthcare workers with the ability to understand and over-read relational time pattern centered communications from AI. Medical education will need to place less emphasis on threshold decision making and a greater focus on detection, analysis, and the pathophysiologic basis of relational time patterns. This should be an early part of a medical student\u2019s education because this is what their hospital companion (the AI) will be doing.Effective communication between human and artificial intelligence requires a common pattern centered knowledge base. Experts in safety focused human to human communication in hospitals should lead during this transition process.",

            "paperAbstract": "The question: \"What is an appropriate role for AI?\" is the subject of much discussion and interest. Arguments about whether AI should be a human replacing technology or a human assisting technology frequently take centre stage. Education is no exception when it comes to questions about the role that AI should play, and as with many other professional areas, the exact role of AI in education is not easy to predict. Here, we argue that one potential role for AI in education is to provide opportunities for human intelligence augmentation, with AI supporting us in decision\u2010making processes, rather than replacing us through automation. To provide empirical evidence to support our argument, we present a case study in the context of debate tutoring, in which we use prediction and classification models to increase the transparency of the intuitive decision\u2010making processes of expert tutors for advanced reflections and feedback. Furthermore, we compare the accuracy of unimodal and multimodal classification models of expert human tutors' decisions about the social and emotional aspects of tutoring while evaluating trainees. Our results show that multimodal data leads to more accurate classification models in the context we studied. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

This field, known as \"artificial intelligence\" (AI), is making significant progress in areas such as automated clinical decision making, medical imaging analysis, and interventional procedures, and has the potential to dramatically influence the practice of interventional cardiology. The unique nature of interventional cardiology makes it an ideal target for the development of AI-based technologies designed to improve real-time clinical decision making, streamline workflow in the catheterization laboratory, and standardize catheter-based procedures through advanced robotics. This review provides an introduction to AI by highlighting its scope, potential\u00a0applications, and limitations in interventional cardiology.",

            "paperAbstract": "Artificial intelligence can provide organizations with prescriptive options for decision-making. Based on the notions of algorithmic decision-making and user involvement, we assess the role of artificial intelligence in workplace decisions. Using a case study on the implementation and use of cognitive software in a telecommunications company, we address how actors can become distanced from or remain involved in decision-making. Our results show that humans are increasingly detached from decision-making spatially as well as temporally and in terms of rational distancing and cognitive displacement. At the same time, they remain attached to decision-making because of accidental and infrastructural proximity, imposed engagement, and affective adhesion. When human and algorithmic intelligence become unbalanced in regard to humans\u2019 attachment to decision-making, three performative effects result: deferred decisions, workarounds, and (data) manipulations. We conceptualize the user interface that presents decisions to humans as a mediator between human detachment and attachment and, thus, between algorithmic and humans\u2019 decisions. These findings contrast the traditional view of automated media as diminishing user involvement and have useful implications for research on artificial intelligence and algorithmic decision-making in organizations.",

For AI applications with a moral component, are we then forced to build systems based on many ad-hoc rules? In this paper we discuss possible ways to avoid this conclusion.",

            "paperAbstract": "By leveraging deep learning-based technologies, industrial artificial intelligence (IAI) has been applied to solve various industrial challenging problems in Industry 4.0. However, for privacy reasons, traditional centralized training may be unsuitable for sensitive data-driven industrial scenarios, such as healthcare and autopilot. Recently, federated learning has received widespread attention, since it enables participants to collaboratively learn a shared model without revealing their local data. However, studies have shown that, by exploiting the shared parameters adversaries can still compromise industrial applications such as auto-driving navigation systems, medical data in wearable devices, and industrial robots\u2019 decision making. In this article, to solve this problem, we propose an efficient and privacy-enhanced federated learning (PEFL) scheme for IAI. Compared with existing solutions, PEFL is noninteractive, and can prevent private data from being leaked even if multiple entities collude with each other. Moreover, extensive experiments with real-world data demonstrate the superiority of PEFL in terms of accuracy and efficiency.",

            "paperAbstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging focus area of policy development in India. The country's regional influence, burgeoning AI industry and ambitious governmental initiatives around AI make it an important jurisdiction to consider, regardless of where the reader of this article lives. Even as existing policy processes intend to encourage the rapid development of AI for economic growth and social good, an overarching trend persists in India, and several other jurisdictions: the limitations and risks of data-driven decisions still feature as retrospective considerations for development and deployment of AI applications. This article argues that the technical limitations of AI systems should be reckoned with at the time of developing policy, and the societal and ethical concerns that arise due to such limitations should be used to inform what policy processes aspire to achieve. It proposes a framework for such deliberation to occur, by analysing the three main stages of bringing machine learning (the most popular subset of AI techniques) to deployment\u2014the data, model and application stage. It is written against the backdrop of India's current AI policy landscape, and applies the proposed framework to ongoing sectoral challenges in India. With a view to influence existing policy deliberation in the country, it focuses on potential risks that arise from data-driven decisions in general, and in the Indian context in particular. This article is part of the theme issue \u2018Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal, and technical opportunities and challenges'.",

We suggest that machine learning technologies could be harnessed to integrate data mined from electronic health records (EHRs) and social media in order to estimate the confidence of the prediction that a patient would consent to a given treatment. We call this process, which takes data about patients as input and derives a confidence estimate for a particular patient's predicted health care-related decision as an output, the autonomy algorithm. We suggest that the proposed algorithm would result in more accurate predictions than existing methods, which are resource intensive and consider only small patient cohorts. This algorithm could become a valuable tool in medical decision-making processes, augmenting the capacity of all people to make health care decisions in difficult situations.",

To provide a comprehensive perspective on the development of distributed linguistic representations in decision making, we present the taxonomy of existing distributed linguistic representations. Then, we review the key elements and applications of distributed linguistic information processing in decision making, including the distance measurement, aggregation methods, distributed linguistic preference relations, and distributed linguistic multiple attribute decision making models. Next, we provide a discussion on ongoing challenges and future research directions from the perspective of data science and explainable artificial intelligence.",

            "paperAbstract": "Explainable AI provides insight into the \"why\" for model predictions, offering potential for users to better understand and trust a model, and to recognize and correct AI predictions that are incorrect. Prior research on human and explainable AI interactions has focused on measures such as interpretability, trust, and usability of the explanation. Whether explainable AI can improve actual human decision-making and the ability to identify the problems with the underlying model are open questions. Using real datasets, we compare and evaluate objective human decision accuracy without AI (control), with an AI prediction (no explanation), and AI prediction with explanation. We find providing any kind of AI prediction tends to improve user decision accuracy, but no conclusive evidence that explainable AI has a meaningful impact. Moreover, we observed the strongest predictor for human decision accuracy was AI accuracy and that users were somewhat able to detect when the AI was correct versus incorrect, but this was not significantly affected by including an explanation. Our results indicate that, at least in some situations, the \"why\" information provided in explainable AI may not enhance user decision-making, and further research may be needed to understand how to integrate explainable AI into real systems.",

The database consisted of 2,603 cycles (1,853 autologous and 750 donor cycles) incorporating 7,376 visits for training. An additional 556 unique cycles were used for challenge and to calculate accuracy. There were 59,706 data points. Input variables included estradiol concentrations in picograms per milliliter; ultrasound measurements of follicle diameters in two dimensions in millimeters; cycle day during stimulation and dose of recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone during ovarian stimulation for IVF.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)\nAccuracy of the algorithm to predict four critical clinical decisions during ovarian stimulation for IVF: [1] stop stimulation or continue stimulation. If the decision was to stop, then the next automated decision was to [2] trigger or cancel. If the decision was to return, then the next key decisions were [3] number of days to follow-up and [4] whether any dosage adjustment was needed.\n\n\nRESULT(S)\nAlgorithm accuracies for these four decisions are as follows: continue or stop treatment: 0.92; trigger and schedule oocyte retrieval or cancel cycle: 0.96; dose of medication adjustment: 0.82; and number of days to follow-up: 0.87. These accuracies are for first iteration of the algorithm.\n\n\nCONCLUSION(S)\nWe describe a first iteration of a predictive analytic algorithm that is highly accurate and in agreement with evidence-based decisions by expert teams during ovarian stimulation during IVF. These tools offer a potential platform to optimize clinical decision making during IVF.",

Key challenges exist in understanding the data for robust clinical decision-support. Limitations of traditional methodologies to handle these data led to the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI). This article emphasizes the capabilities of AI to identify patterns of SSI data. Method: Artificial intelligence comprises various subfields that present potential solutions to identify patterns of SSI data. Discussions on opportunities, challenges, and limitations of applying these methods to derive accurate SSI prediction are provided. Results: Four main challenges in dealing with SSI data were defined: (1) complexities in using SSI data, (2) disease knowledge, (3) decision support, and (4) heterogeneity. The implications of some of the recent advances in AI methods to optimize clinical effectiveness were discussed. Conclusions: Artificial intelligence has the potential to provide insight in detecting and decision-support of SSI. As we turn SSI data into intelligence about the disease, we increase the possibility of improving surgical practice with the promise of a future optimized for the highest quality patient care.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract Precision medicine is one of the recent and powerful developments in medical care, which has the potential to improve the traditional symptom-driven practice of medicine, allowing earlier interventions using advanced diagnostics and tailoring better and economically personalized treatments. Identifying the best pathway to personalized and population medicine involves the ability to analyze comprehensive patient information together with broader aspects to monitor and distinguish between sick and relatively healthy people, which will lead to a better understanding of biological indicators that can signal shifts in health. While the complexities of disease at the individual level have made it difficult to utilize healthcare information in clinical decision-making, some of the existing constraints have been greatly minimized by technological advancements. To implement effective precision medicine with enhanced ability to positively impact patient outcomes and provide real-time decision support, it is important to harness the power of electronic health records by integrating disparate data sources and discovering patient-specific patterns of disease progression. Useful analytic tools, technologies, databases, and approaches are required to augment networking and interoperability of clinical, laboratory and public health systems, as well as addressing ethical and social issues related to the privacy and protection of healthcare data with effective balance. Developing multifunctional machine learning platforms for clinical data extraction, aggregation, management and analysis can support clinicians by efficiently stratifying subjects to understand specific scenarios and optimize decision-making. Implementation of artificial intelligence in healthcare is a compelling vision that has the potential in leading to the significant improvements for achieving the goals of providing real-time, better personalized and population medicine at lower costs. In this study, we focused on analyzing and discussing various published artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions, approaches and perspectives, aiming to advance academic solutions in paving the way for a new data-centric era of discovery in healthcare.",

In the evolving relationship between humans and AI, trust is the one mechanism that shapes clinicians\u2019 use and adoption of AI. Trust is a psychological mechanism to deal with the uncertainty between what is known and unknown. Several research studies have highlighted the need for improving AI-based systems and enhancing their capabilities to help clinicians. However, assessing the magnitude and impact of human trust on AI technology demands substantial attention. Will a clinician trust an AI-based system? What are the factors that influence human trust in AI? Can trust in AI be optimized to improve decision-making processes? In this paper, we focus on clinicians as the primary users of AI systems in health care and present factors shaping trust between clinicians and AI. We highlight critical challenges related to trust that should be considered during the development of any AI system for clinical use.",

            "paperAbstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on education. Premised on a narrative and framework for assessing AI identified from a preliminary analysis, the scope of the study was limited to the application and effects of AI in administration, instruction, and learning. A qualitative research approach, leveraging the use of literature review as a research design and approach was used and effectively facilitated the realization of the study purpose. Artificial intelligence is a field of study and the resulting innovations and developments that have culminated in computers, machines, and other artifacts having human-like intelligence characterized by cognitive abilities, learning, adaptability, and decision-making capabilities. The study ascertained that AI has extensively been adopted and used in education, particularly by education institutions, in different forms. AI initially took the form of computer and computer related technologies, transitioning to web-based and online intelligent education systems, and ultimately with the use of embedded computer systems, together with other technologies, the use of humanoid robots and web-based chatbots to perform instructors\u2019 duties and functions independently or with instructors. Using these platforms, instructors have been able to perform different administrative functions, such as reviewing and grading students\u2019 assignments more effectively and efficiently, and achieve higher quality in their teaching activities. On the other hand, because the systems leverage machine learning and adaptability, curriculum and content has been customized and personalized in line with students\u2019 needs, which has fostered uptake and retention, thereby improving learners experience and overall quality of learning.",

            "title": "Explainability for artificial intelligence in healthcare: a multidisciplinary perspective",
            "paperAbstract": "Background Explainability is one of the most heavily debated topics when it comes to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare. Even though AI-driven systems have been shown to outperform humans in certain analytical tasks, the lack of explainability continues to spark criticism. Yet, explainability is not a purely technological issue, instead it invokes a host of medical, legal, ethical, and societal questions that require thorough exploration. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the role of explainability in medical AI and makes an ethical evaluation of what explainability means for the adoption of AI-driven tools into clinical practice. Methods Taking AI-based clinical decision support systems as a case in point, we adopted a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the relevance of explainability for medical AI from the technological, legal, medical, and patient perspectives. Drawing on the findings of this conceptual analysis, we then conducted an ethical assessment using the \u201cPrinciples of Biomedical Ethics\u201d by Beauchamp and Childress (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice) as an analytical framework to determine the need for explainability in medical AI. Results Each of the domains highlights a different set of core considerations and values that are relevant for understanding the role of explainability in clinical practice. From the technological point of view, explainability has to be considered both in terms how it can be achieved and what is beneficial from a development perspective. When looking at the legal perspective we identified informed consent, certification and approval as medical devices, and liability as core touchpoints for explainability. Both the medical and patient perspectives emphasize the importance of considering the interplay between human actors and medical AI. We conclude that omitting explainability in clinical decision support systems poses a threat to core ethical values in medicine and may have detrimental consequences for individual and public health. Conclusions To ensure that medical AI lives up to its promises, there is a need to sensitize developers, healthcare professionals, and legislators to the challenges and limitations of opaque algorithms in medical AI and to foster multidisciplinary collaboration moving forward.",

            "paperAbstract": "Background Positive economic impact is a key decision factor in making the case for or against investing in an artificial intelligence (AI) solution in the health care industry. It is most relevant for the care provider and insurer as well as for the pharmaceutical and medical technology sectors. Although the broad economic impact of digital health solutions in general has been assessed many times in literature and the benefit for patients and society has also been analyzed, the specific economic impact of AI in health care has been addressed only sporadically. Objective This study aimed to systematically review and summarize the cost-effectiveness studies dedicated to AI in health care and to assess whether they meet the established quality criteria. Methods In a first step, the quality criteria for economic impact studies were defined based on the established and adapted criteria schemes for cost impact assessments. In a second step, a systematic literature review based on qualitative and quantitative inclusion and exclusion criteria was conducted to identify relevant publications for an in-depth analysis of the economic impact assessment. In a final step, the quality of the identified economic impact studies was evaluated based on the defined quality criteria for cost-effectiveness studies. Results Very few publications have thoroughly addressed the economic impact assessment, and the economic assessment quality of the reviewed publications on AI shows severe methodological deficits. Only 6 out of 66 publications could be included in the second step of the analysis based on the inclusion criteria. Out of these 6 studies, none comprised a methodologically complete cost impact analysis. There are two areas for improvement in future studies. First, the initial investment and operational costs for the AI infrastructure and service need to be included. Second, alternatives to achieve similar impact must be evaluated to provide a comprehensive comparison. Conclusions This systematic literature analysis proved that the existing impact assessments show methodological deficits and that upcoming evaluations require more comprehensive economic analyses to enable economic decisions for or against implementing AI technology in health care.",

            "paperAbstract": "The increasing computational power and proliferation of big data are now empowering Artificial Intelligence (AI) to achieve massive adoption and applicability in many fields. The lack of explanation when it comes to the decisions made by today's AI algorithms is a major drawback in critical decision\u2010making systems. For example, deep learning does not offer control or reasoning over its internal processes or outputs. More importantly, current black\u2010box AI implementations are subject to bias and adversarial attacks that may poison the learning or the inference processes. Explainable AI (XAI) is a new trend of AI algorithms that provide explanations of their AI decisions. In this paper, we propose a framework for achieving a more trustworthy and XAI by leveraging features of blockchain, smart contracts, trusted oracles, and decentralized storage. We specify a framework for complex AI systems in which the decision outcomes are reached based on decentralized consensuses of multiple AI and XAI predictors. The paper discusses how our proposed framework can be utilized in key application areas with practical use cases.",

            "paperAbstract": "Simulation-based training is increasingly being used for assessment and training of psychomotor skills involved in medicine. The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies has provided new methodologies to utilize large amounts of data for educational purposes. A significant criticism of the use of artificial intelligence in education has been a lack of transparency in the algorithms\u2019 decision-making processes. This study aims to 1) introduce a new framework using explainable artificial intelligence for simulation-based training in surgery, and 2) validate the framework by creating the Virtual Operative Assistant, an automated educational feedback platform. Twenty-eight skilled participants (14 staff neurosurgeons, 4 fellows, 10 PGY 4\u20136 residents) and 22 novice participants (10 PGY 1\u20133 residents, 12 medical students) took part in this study. Participants performed a virtual reality subpial brain tumor resection task on the NeuroVR simulator using a simulated ultrasonic aspirator and bipolar. Metrics of performance were developed, and leave-one-out cross validation was employed to train and validate a support vector machine in Matlab. The classifier was combined with a unique educational system to build the Virtual Operative Assistant which provides users with automated feedback on their metric performance with regards to expert proficiency performance benchmarks. The Virtual Operative Assistant successfully classified skilled and novice participants using 4 metrics with an accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of 92, 82 and 100%, respectively. A 2-step feedback system was developed to provide participants with an immediate visual representation of their standing related to expert proficiency performance benchmarks. The educational system outlined establishes a basis for the potential role of integrating artificial intelligence and virtual reality simulation into surgical educational teaching. The potential of linking expertise classification, objective feedback based on proficiency benchmarks, and instructor input creates a novel educational tool by integrating these three components into a formative educational paradigm.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract The prospect of patient harm caused by the decisions made by an artificial intelligence-based clinical tool is something to which current practices of accountability and safety worldwide have not yet adjusted. We focus on two aspects of clinical artificial intelligence used for decision-making: moral accountability for harm to patients; and safety assurance to protect patients against such harm. Artificial intelligence-based tools are challenging the standard clinical practices of assigning blame and assuring safety. Human clinicians and safety engineers have weaker control over the decisions reached by artificial intelligence systems and less knowledge and understanding of precisely how the artificial intelligence systems reach their decisions. We illustrate this analysis by applying it to an example of an artificial intelligence-based system developed for use in the treatment of sepsis. The paper ends with practical suggestions for ways forward to mitigate these concerns. We argue for a need to include artificial intelligence developers and systems safety engineers in our assessments of moral accountability for patient harm. Meanwhile, none of the actors in the model robustly fulfil the traditional conditions of moral accountability for the decisions of an artificial intelligence system. We should therefore update our conceptions of moral accountability in this context. We also need to move from a static to a dynamic model of assurance, accepting that considerations of safety are not fully resolvable during the design of the artificial intelligence system before the system has been deployed.",

            "paperAbstract": "Advancements in computing and data from the near universal acceptance and implementation of electronic health records has been formative for the growth of personalized, automated, and immediate patient care models that were not previously possible. Artificial intelligence (AI) and its subfields of machine learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning are well-suited to deal with such data. The authors in this paper review current applications of AI in clinical medicine and discuss the most likely future contributions that AI will provide to the healthcare industry. For instance, in response to the need to risk stratify patients, appropriately cultivated and curated data can assist decision-makers in stratifying preoperative patients into risk categories, as well as categorizing the severity of ailments and health for non-operative patients admitted to hospitals. Previous overt, traditional vital signs and laboratory values that are used to signal alarms for an acutely decompensating patient may be replaced by continuously monitoring and updating AI tools that can pick up early imperceptible patterns predicting subtle health deterioration. Furthermore, AI may help overcome challenges with multiple outcome optimization limitations or sequential decision-making protocols that limit individualized patient care. Despite these tremendously helpful advancements, the data sets that AI models train on and develop have the potential for misapplication and thereby create concerns for application bias. Subsequently, the mechanisms governing this disruptive innovation must be understood by clinical decision-makers to prevent unnecessary harm. This need will force physicians to change their educational infrastructure to facilitate understanding AI platforms, modeling, and limitations to best acclimate practice in the age of AI. By performing a thorough narrative review, this paper examines these specific AI applications, limitations, and requisites while reviewing a few examples of major data sets that are being cultivated and curated in the US.",

            "paperAbstract": "Judgement, as one of the core tenets of medicine, relies upon the integration of multilayered data with nuanced decision making. Cancer offers a unique context for medical decisions given not only its variegated forms with evolution of disease but also the need to take into account the individual condition of patients, their ability to receive treatment, and their responses to treatment. Challenges remain in the accurate detection, characterization, and monitoring of cancers despite improved technologies. Radiographic assessment of disease most commonly relies upon visual evaluations, the interpretations of which may be augmented by advanced computational analyses. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make great strides in the qualitative interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians, including volumetric delineation of tumors over time, extrapolation of the tumor genotype and biological course from its radiographic phenotype, prediction of clinical outcome, and assessment of the impact of disease and treatment on adjacent organs. AI may automate processes in the initial interpretation of images and shift the clinical workflow of radiographic detection, management decisions on whether or not to administer an intervention, and subsequent observation to a yet to be envisioned paradigm. Here, the authors review the current state of AI as applied to medical imaging of cancer and describe advances in 4 tumor types (lung, brain, breast, and prostate) to illustrate how common clinical problems are being addressed. Although most studies evaluating AI applications in oncology to date have not been vigorously validated for reproducibility and generalizability, the results do highlight increasingly concerted efforts in pushing AI technology to clinical use and to impact future directions in cancer care.",

Nurses make diagnoses according to professional knowledge, clinical experience, and even instinct. Without comprehensive knowledge and thinking, diagnostic accuracy can be compromised and decisions may be delayed. We used a back-propagation neural network and other tools for data mining and statistical analysis. We further compared the prediction accuracy of the previous methods with an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system and the back-propagation neural network, identifying differences in the questions and in nurse satisfaction levels before and after using the nursing information system. This study investigated the use of artificial intelligence to generate nursing diagnoses. The percentage of agreement between diagnoses suggested by the information system and those made by nurses was as much as 87 percent. When patients are hospitalized, we can calculate the probability of various nursing diagnoses based on certain characteristics.",

            "paperAbstract": "Scientific knowledge has been traditionally disseminated and preserved through research articles published in journals, conference proceedings, and online archives. However, this article-centric paradigm has been often criticized for not allowing to automatically process, categorize, and reason on this knowledge. An alternative vision is to generate a semantically rich and interlinked description of the content of research publications. In this paper, we present the Artificial Intelligence Knowledge Graph (AI-KG), a large-scale automatically generated knowledge graph that describes 820K research entities. AI-KG includes about 14M RDF triples and 1.2M reified statements extracted from 333K research publications in the field of AI, and describes 5 types of entities (tasks, methods, metrics, materials, others) linked by 27 relations. AI-KG has been designed to support a variety of intelligent services for analyzing and making sense of research dynamics, supporting researchers in their daily job, and helping to inform decision-making in funding bodies and research policymakers. AI-KG has been generated by applying an automatic pipeline that extracts entities and relationships using three tools: DyGIE++, Stanford CoreNLP, and the CSO Classifier. It then integrates and filters the resulting triples using a combination of deep learning and semantic technologies in order to produce a high-quality knowledge graph. This pipeline was evaluated on a manually crafted gold standard, yielding competitive results. AI-KG is available under CC BY 4.0 and can be downloaded as a dump or queried via a SPARQL endpoint.",

            "paperAbstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming our lifestyle intending to mimic human intelligence by a computer/machine in solving various issues. Initially, AI was designed to overcome simpler problems like winning a chess game, language recognition, image retrieval, among others. With the technological advancements, AI is getting increasingly sophisticated at doing what humans do, but more efficiently, rapidly, and at a lower cost in solving complex problems. AI in healthcare provides an upper hand undoubtedly over traditional analytics and clinical decision-making techniques. Machine learning (ML) algorithms, a subset of AI, can detect patterns from huge complex datasets to become more precise and accurate as they interact with training data, allowing humans to gain unprecedented insights into early detection of diseases, drug discovery, diagnostics, healthcare processes, treatment variability, and patient outcomes. But how effective are the AI algorithms during a disease outbreak or for that matter a pandemic? After 2000, the pandemics are testing the AI's ability to handle extreme events. The two major factors affecting AI algorithms include the availability of historical and real-time data and high computational power. The different roles played by AI during pandemics are early warning and alerts, prediction and detection of outbreak of diseases, real-time disease monitoring worldwide, analysis and visualisation of spreading trends, prediction of infection rate and infection trend, rapid decision-making to identify the effective treatments, study and analysis of the pathogens, and drug discovery. All these are executed at a greater speed with AI. WHO and CDC (United States) are receiving data of several diseases and situations occurring across the world. With modern computer architecture and internet, all these data can be accessed in real-time by different institutes to develop an autonomous or collaborative AI model to handle various tasks. In addition to the official data, AI can gather information from news outlets, forums, healthcare reports, travel data, social media posts, and others in multiple languages across the world by using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and flag their priority. Several terabytes of data which includes patients' case history, geographical events, and social media posts about a new pneumonia are processed at a rapid rate with high-performance computing to predict the possible outbreak of a pandemic. Most importantly unsupervised ML can identify its own pattern from the noise (historical and real-time data) rather than the training it on a preselected dataset, thus giving a wider possibility and new behaviour. An AI model trained to predict a particular disease can be retrained on the new data of a new or different disease. Some noticeable examples of AI that are used to battle the COVID-19 pandemic and others are as follows:",

Growing datasets provide a sound basis with which to apply machine learning methods that learn from previous experiences. This review explains the basics of machine learning and its subfields of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning and deep learning. We provide an overview of current machine learning applications in rheumatology, mainly supervised learning methods for e-diagnosis, disease detection and medical image analysis. In the future, machine learning will be likely to assist rheumatologists in predicting the course of the disease and identifying important disease factors. Even more interestingly, machine learning will probably be able to make treatment propositions and estimate their expected benefit (e.g. by reinforcement learning). Thus, in future, shared decision-making will not only include the patient\u2019s opinion and the rheumatologist\u2019s empirical and evidence-based experience, but it will also be influenced by machine-learned evidence.",

            "paperAbstract": "Background COVID-19 was first discovered in December 2019 and has since evolved into a pandemic. Objective To address this global health crisis, artificial intelligence (AI) has been deployed at various levels of the health care system. However, AI has both potential benefits and limitations. We therefore conducted a review of AI applications for COVID-19. Methods We performed an extensive search of the PubMed and EMBASE databases for COVID-19\u2013related English-language studies published between December 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020. We supplemented the database search with reference list checks. A thematic analysis and narrative review of AI applications for COVID-19 was conducted. Results In total, 11 papers were included for review. AI was applied to COVID-19 in four areas: diagnosis, public health, clinical decision making, and therapeutics. We identified several limitations including insufficient data, omission of multimodal methods of AI-based assessment, delay in realization of benefits, poor internal/external validation, inability to be used by laypersons, inability to be used in resource-poor settings, presence of ethical pitfalls, and presence of legal barriers. AI could potentially be explored in four other areas: surveillance, combination with big data, operation of other core clinical services, and management of patients with COVID-19. Conclusions In view of the continuing increase in the number of cases, and given that multiple waves of infections may occur, there is a need for effective methods to help control the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its shortcomings, AI holds the potential to greatly augment existing human efforts, which may otherwise be overwhelmed by high patient numbers.",

In ophthalmology in particular, the volume range of data captured in EHR systems has been growing rapidly. Yet making effective secondary use of this EHR data for improving patient care and facilitating clinical decision-making has remained challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of these data. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques present a promising way to analyze these multimodal data sets. While AI techniques have been extensively applied to imaging data, there are a limited number of studies employing AI techniques with clinical data from the EHR. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of different AI methods applied to EHR data in the field of ophthalmology. This literature review highlights that the secondary use of EHR data has focused on glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and cataracts with the use of AI techniques. These techniques have been used to improve ocular disease diagnosis, risk assessment, and progression prediction. Techniques such as supervised machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing were most commonly used in the articles reviewed.",

            "paperAbstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) research has become prominent in both academia and industry. With this, an interest in AI's ability to make sound decisions when compared to human decision making has grown. Predicting the outcome of sporting events has traditionally been seen as a difficult task, due to the complex relationships between variables of interest. Attempts to make accurate predictions are fraught with biases owing to the bounded rationality within which human decision making functions. This study puts forward the position that an AI approach using machine learning will yield a comparable level of accuracy. A random forest classification algorithm was employed to predict match outcomes in the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The performance of this model was compared to aggregate results from Super-Bru and OddsPortal. The machine learning based system achieved an accuracy of 89.58% with 95%-CI (77.83, 95.47) vs. 85.42% with 95%-CI (72.83, 92.75) for the platforms. These results indicate that for rugby, over the limited period of a specific tournament, the evidence was not strong enough to suggest that a human agent is superior in terms of accuracy when predicting match outcomes compared to a machine learning approach, at a significance level \u03b1 = 0.05. However, the model was better able to estimate probabilities as measured by monetary winnings from betting rounds compared to the two platforms.",

To fill this research gap, we develop a robo-advisor with different machine learning and deep learning forecasting methodologies and utilize the forecasting result of the portfolio optimization model to support our investors in making decisions. This research integrated several dimensions of technologies, which contain machine learning, data analytics, and portfolio optimization. We focused on developing robo-advisor framework and utilized algorithms by integrating machine learning and deep learning approaches with the portfolio optimization algorithm by using our predicted trends and results to replace the historical data and investor views. We eliminate the extreme fluctuation to maintain our trading within the acceptable risk coefficient. Accordingly, we can minimize the investment risk and reach a relatively stable return. We compared different algorithms and found that the F1 score of the model prediction significantly affects the result of the optimized portfolio. We used our deep learning model with the highest winning rate and leveraged the prediction result with the portfolio optimization algorithm to reach 12% of annual return, which outperform our benchmark index 0050.

            "paperAbstract": "Selection/replacements are an indispensable part in evolutionary algorithms (EAs), which are generally based on a single evaluation criterion. However, selections in nature are based on multi evaluation criteria, such as multi-aspect survival criteria of wolves (like running and attacking abilities). To realize more real survival of the fittest in EAs, multicriteria decision making selection/replacement (MCDMSR) is proposed. In fact, there is little research about using multicriteria decision making to improve selection/replacement models in EAs. VIKOR (a multicriteria decision making method) in management science is used in MCDMSR, and multi evaluation criteria of the populations are synthetically analyzed as a radar chart form. By using VIKOR, MCDMSR is able to respond to the population-state change in real time. MCDMSR is characterized by this agility, and this agility is derived from the decision making ability of VIKOR. Moreover, principle analysis and discussions are given to explain the feasibility of multicriteria decision making in the applications of selection/replacements. We provided the applications of MCDMSR in simple genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, artificial fish swarm algorithm, and shuffled frog leaping algorithm, by comparing with tournament selection, fine-grained tournament selection, all-individual-guider replacement, CD/RW, constrained-visual-region replacement, group constrained-visual-region replacement, part-individual-guider replacement for 36 benchmarks (i.e., 5 unimodal and 15 multimodal problems in CEC 2013 test suite, and 16 P-Peak problems). The effectiveness, efficiency, and diversity results of MCDMSR were acceptable.",

            "paperAbstract": "OBJECTIVE\nIn the modern healthcare system, rapidly expanding costs/complexity, the growing myriad of treatment options, and exploding information streams that often do not effectively reach the front lines hinder the ability to choose optimal treatment decisions over time. The goal in this paper is to develop a general purpose (non-disease-specific) computational/artificial intelligence (AI) framework to address these challenges. This framework serves two potential functions: (1) a simulation environment for exploring various healthcare policies, payment methodologies, etc., and (2) the basis for clinical artificial intelligence - an AI that can \"think like a doctor\".\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis approach combines Markov decision processes and dynamic decision networks to learn from clinical data and develop complex plans via simulation of alternative sequential decision paths while capturing the sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic interactions of various components in the healthcare system. It can operate in partially observable environments (in the case of missing observations or data) by maintaining belief states about patient health status and functions as an online agent that plans and re-plans as actions are performed and new observations are obtained. This framework was evaluated using real patient data from an electronic health record.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach; such an AI framework easily outperforms the current treatment-as-usual (TAU) case-rate/fee-for-service models of healthcare. The cost per unit of outcome change (CPUC) was $189 vs. $497 for AI vs. TAU (where lower is considered optimal) - while at the same time the AI approach could obtain a 30-35% increase in patient outcomes. Tweaking certain AI model parameters could further enhance this advantage, obtaining approximately 50% more improvement (outcome change) for roughly half the costs.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nGiven careful design and problem formulation, an AI simulation framework can approximate optimal decisions even in complex and uncertain environments. Future work is described that outlines potential lines of research and integration of machine learning algorithms for personalized medicine.",

Problems with timing, efficiency, and missed diagnoses occur at all stages of the imaging chain. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) is dependent on robust data; the application of appropriate computational approaches and tools; and validation of its clinical application to image segmentation, automated measurements, and eventually, automated diagnosis. AI may reduce cost and improve value at the stages of image acquisition, interpretation, and decision-making. Moreover, the precision now possible with cardiovascular imaging, combined with \"big data\" from the electronic health record and pathology, is likely to better characterize disease and personalize therapy. This review summarizes recent promising applications of AI in cardiology and cardiac imaging, which potentially add value to patient care.",

            "paperAbstract": "Supply chain risk management (SCRM) encompasses a wide variety of strategies aiming to identify, assess, mitigate and monitor unexpected events or conditions which might have an impact, mostly adverse, on any part of a supply chain. SCRM strategies often depend on rapid and adaptive decision-making based on potentially large, multidimensional data sources. These characteristics make SCRM a suitable application area for artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of supply chain literature that addresses problems relevant to SCRM using approaches that fall within the AI spectrum. To that end, an investigation is conducted on the various definitions and classifications of supply chain risk and related notions such as uncertainty. Then, a mapping study is performed to categorise existing literature according to the AI methodology used, ranging from mathematical programming to Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics, and the specific SCRM task they address (identification, assessment or response). Finally, a comprehensive analysis of each category is provided to identify missing aspects and unexplored areas and propose directions for future research at the confluence of SCRM and AI.",

            "paperAbstract": "Transparency is now a fundamental principle for data processing under the General Data Protection Regulation. We explore what this requirement entails for artificial intelligence and automated decision-making systems. We address the topic of transparency in artificial intelligence by integrating legal, social, and ethical aspects. We first investigate the ratio legis of the transparency requirement in the General Data Protection Regulation and its ethical underpinnings, showing its focus on the provision of information and explanation. We then discuss the pitfalls with respect to this requirement by focusing on the significance of contextual and performative factors in the implementation of transparency. We show that human\u2013computer interaction and human-robot interaction literature do not provide clear results with respect to the benefits of transparency for users of artificial intelligence technologies due to the impact of a wide range of contextual factors, including performative aspects. We conclude by integrating the information- and explanation-based approach to transparency with the critical contextual approach, proposing that transparency as required by the General Data Protection Regulation in itself may be insufficient to achieve the positive goals associated with transparency. Instead, we propose to understand transparency relationally, where information provision is conceptualized as communication between technology providers and users, and where assessments of trustworthiness based on contextual factors mediate the value of transparency communications. This relational concept of transparency points to future research directions for the study of transparency in artificial intelligence systems and should be taken into account in policymaking.",

Diverse and highly skilled research groups must integrate efforts to bridge the gaps needed to achieve international goals toward sustainable agriculture. Given the scale of global agricultural needs and the breadth of multiple types of omics data needed to optimize these efforts, explainable artificial intelligence (AI with a decipherable decision making process that provides a meaningful explanation to humans) and exascale computing (computers that can perform 1018 floating-point operations per second, or exaflops) are crucial. Accurate phenotyping and daily-resolution climatype associations are equally important for refining ideotype production to specific environments at various levels of granularity.

            "paperAbstract": "The ever-increasing amount of biomedical data is enabling new large-scale studies, even though ad hoc computational solutions are required. The most recent Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been achieving outstanding performance and an important impact in clinical research, aiming at precision medicine as well as improving healthcare workflows. However, the inherent heterogeneity and uncertainty in the healthcare information sources pose new compelling challenges for clinicians in their decision-making tasks. Only the proper combination of AI and human intelligence capabilities, by explicitly taking into account effective and safe interaction paradigms, can permit the delivery of care that outperforms what either can do separately. Therefore, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) plays a crucial role in the design of software oriented to decision-making in medicine. In this work, we systematically review and discuss several research fields strictly linked to HCI and clinical decision-making, by subdividing the articles into six themes, namely: Interfaces,Visualization,ElectronicHealthRecords,Devices,Usability, and ClinicalDecisionSupportSystems. However, these articles typically present overlaps among the themes, revealing that HCI inter-connects multiple topics. With the goal of focusing on HCI and design aspects, the articles under consideration were grouped into four clusters. The advances in AI can effectively support the physicians' cognitive processes, which certainly play a central role in decision-making tasks because the human mental behavior cannot be completely emulated and captured; the human mind might solve a complex problem even without a statistically significant amount of data by relying upon domain knowledge. For this reason, technology must focus on interactive solutions for supporting the physicians effectively in their daily activities, by exploiting their unique knowledge and evidence-based reasoning, as well as improving the various aspects highlighted in this review.",

            "paperAbstract": "BACKGROUND\nScreening and early diagnosis of mitral regurgitation (MR) are crucial for preventing irreversible progression of MR. In this study, we developed and validated an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for detecting MR using electrocardiography (ECG).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis retrospective cohort study included data from two hospital. An AI algorithm was trained using 56,670 ECGs from 24,202 patients. Internal validation of the algorithm was performed with 3174 ECGs of 3174 patients from one hospital, while external validation was performed with 10,865 ECGs of 10,865 patients from another hospital. The endpoint was the diagnosis of significant MR, moderate to severe, confirmed by echocardiography. We used 500\u00a0Hz ECG raw data as predictive variables. Additionally, we showed regions of ECG that have the most significant impact on the decision-making of the AI algorithm using a sensitivity map.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring the internal and external validation, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the AI algorithm using a 12-lead ECG for detecting MR was 0.816 and 0.877, respectively, while that using a single-lead ECG was 0.758 and 0.850, respectively. In the 3157 non-MR individuals, those patients that the AI defined as high risk had a significantly higher chance of development of MR than the low risk group (13.9% vs. 2.6%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) during the follow-up period. The sensitivity map showed the AI algorithm focused on the P-wave and T-wave for MR patients and QRS complex for non-MR patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe proposed AI algorithm demonstrated promising results for MR detecting using 12-lead and single-lead ECGs.",

Signals are displayed as images and artificial intelligence allows automated interpretation in order to give a help in the decision making, especially when large structures are inspected (pipelines, reactor vessels...). This paper describes a new approach for data storage, namely sparse matrix structure that avoids image formation. Only the coordinates of pertinent samples regarding a detected defect are stored in a 2D array. In addition to reducing significantly the amount of data to store and to process, sparse representation make possible the exploitation of pattern recognition methods such as Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm to automatic interpretation. Indeed, when a crack is presented in a controlled structure, the graph formed by the sparse matrix elements has a parabolic form and its summit location deals with the crack summit position.",

            "paperAbstract": "In the era of artificial intelligence, the healthcare industry is undergoing tremendous innovation and development based on sophisticated AI algorithms. Focusing on diagnosis process and target disease, this study theoretically proposed an integrated model to optimize traditional medical expense system, and ultimately helps medical staff and patients make more reliable decisions. From the new perspective of total expense estimation and detailed expense analysis, the proposed model innovatively consists of two intelligent modules, with theoretical contribution. The two modules are SVM-based module and SOM-based module. According to the rigorous comparative analysis with two classic AI techniques, back propagation neural networks and random forests, it is demonstrated that the SVM-based module achieved better capability of total expense estimation. Meanwhile, by designing a two-stage clustering process, SOM-based module effectively generated decision clusters and corresponding cluster centers were obtained, that clarified the complex relationship between detailed expense and patient information. To achieve practical contribution, the proposed model was applied to the diagnosis process of coronary heart disease. The real data from a hospital in Shanghai was collected, and the validity and accuracy of the proposed model were verified with rigorous experiments. The proposed model innovatively optimized traditional medical expense system, and intelligently generated reliable decision-making information for both total expense and detailed expense. The successful application on the target disease further indicates that this model is a user-friendly tool for medical expense control and therapeutic regimen strategy.",

In many cases, however, the most powerful machine learning techniques purchase diagnostic or predictive accuracy at the expense of our ability to access \"the knowledge within the machine.\" Without an explanation in terms of reasons or a rationale for particular decisions in individual cases, some commentators regard ceding medical decision-making to black box systems as contravening the profound moral responsibilities of clinicians. I argue, however, that opaque decisions are more common in medicine than critics realize. Moreover, as Aristotle noted over two millennia ago, when our knowledge of causal systems is incomplete and precarious-as it often is in medicine-the ability to explain how results are produced can be less important than the ability to produce such results and empirically verify their accuracy.",

SDN separates the control plane from the data plane and moves the network management to a central point, called the controller, that can be programmed and used as the brain of the network. Recently, the research community has showed an increased tendency to benefit from the recent advancements in the artificial intelligence (AI) field to provide learning abilities and better decision making in SDN. In this study, we provide a detailed overview of the recent efforts to include AI in SDN. Our study showed that the research efforts focused on three main sub-fields of AI namely: machine learning, meta-heuristics and fuzzy inference systems. Accordingly, in this work we investigate their different application areas and potential use, as well as the improvements achieved by including AI-based techniques in the SDN paradigm.",

Method : A narrative review of existing research and evaluation approaches along with expert perspectives drawn from the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Working Group on Technology Assessment and Quality Development in Health Informatics and the European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) Working Group for Assessment of Health Information Systems. Results : There is a rich history and tradition of evaluating AI in healthcare. While evaluators can learn from past efforts, and build on best practice evaluation frameworks and methodologies, questions remain about how to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of AI that dynamically harness vast amounts of genomic, biomarker, phenotype, electronic record, and care delivery data from across health systems. This paper first provides a historical perspective about the evaluation of AI in healthcare. It then examines key challenges of evaluating AI-enabled clinical decision support during design, development, selection, use, and ongoing surveillance. Practical aspects of evaluating AI in healthcare, including approaches to evaluation and indicators to monitor AI are also discussed. Conclusion : Commitment to rigorous initial and ongoing evaluation will be critical to ensuring the safe and effective integration of AI in complex sociotechnical settings. Specific enhancements that are required for the new generation of AI-enabled clinical decision support will emerge through practical application.",

            "paperAbstract": "What Is the Innovation? Intraoperative adverse events are a common and important cause of surgical morbidity.1,2 Strategies to reduce adverse events and mitigate their consequences have traditionally focused on surgical education, structured communication, and adverse event management. However, until now, little could be done to anticipate these events in the operating room. Advances in both data capture in the operating room and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to process these data open the way for real-time clinical decision support tools that can help surgical teams anticipate, understand, and prevent intraoperative events. In a systematic review, 64% of studies reported improvements in clinical decisions with automated decision support, especially if suggestions were provided at the same time as the task.3 Machine learning (ML) techniques can provide this real-time decision support, estimating risk automatically from patient and intraoperative data. However, there has been hesitation to adopt ML techniques in health care4 because these systems can have rare catastrophically incorrect predictions, and high accuracies can be achieved in unexpected ways, such as recognizing patterns in the manner of data recording, rather than in the content of the data themselves. Explainable artificial intelligence is a collection of algorithms that improve on traditional ML techniques by providing the evidence behind predictions. For example, while a traditional ML algorithm in radiology may predict that an image contains evidence of cancer, an XAI system will indicate what and where that evidence is (eg, 3 cm, right lower lobe nodule). In 2018, Lundberg et al5 developed an XAI-based warning system called Prescience that predicts hypoxemia during surgical procedures up to 5 minutes before it occurs. This system monitors vital signs and provides the clinician with a risk score that updates in real time. It also continuously updates the clinician with reasons for its predictions, listing risk factors such as vital sign abnormalities and patient comorbidities. This can act like an additional vital sign, regularly updating information to warn the anesthetist in real time about upcoming risk. With XAI, surgeons can receive similar warnings about upcoming intraoperative events to augment their clinical judgement, helping to avoid complications. Our team is currently working in surgical XAI to use laparoscopic videos to warn surgeons about upcoming bleeding events in the operating room and explain this risk in terms of patient and surgical factors. By anticipating and avoiding adverse events, surgical teams may be able to reduce operative times and improve outcomes for patients.",

The increasing demand for cardiac imaging begins to exceed the number of available interpreting physicians, leaving less time to interpret studies. In addition, the busy clinician is facing the increasingly daunting task of keeping abreast of current medical advancements and the ongoing changes in disease diagnosis and therapy. Committing to memory and recalling such large volumes of information is challenging and is responsible for difficulties in adopting the rapid changes in imaging practice, and is likely partially responsible for errors in patient diagnosis and management. Diagnostic errors rank high in the cause of death in the United States, and are more common than any other medical error and are responsible for most malpractice claims. Most of these errors are related to cognitive errors. The use of artificial intelligence systems that can serve as complementary methods to assist humans with decision making can potentially prevent these errors. The past decades witnessed the development and integration of these tools, which can assist physicians with image interpretation. These tools work to optimize image quality for better visualization and accompany all imaging modalities, starting from patient selection for the appropriate test, patient preparation, image acquisition, processing, and finally interpretation. Current and future directions for technologies that support cardiac imaging physicians are discussed in this review.",

A recent example is PG&E\u2019s forced power outage to contain wildfire risk which led to widespread power disruption. This paper focuses on answering two questions: who is responsible for resilience? and how to quantify the monetary value of resilience? To this end, we first provide preliminary definitions of resilience for power systems. We then investigate the role of natural hazards, especially wildfire, on power system resilience. Finally, we will propose a decentralized strategy for a resilient management system using distributed storage and demand response resources. Our proposed high fidelity model provides utilities, operators, and policymakers with a clearer picture for strategic decision making and preventive decisions.",

Nodes locally process and execute analytics tasks over contextual data. Demanding inferential analytics are crucial for supporting local real-time applications, however, they deplete nodes' resources. We contribute with a distributed methodology that pushes the task allocation decision at the network edge by intelligently scheduling and distributing analytics tasks among nodes. Each node autonomously decides whether the tasks are conditionally executed locally, or in networked neighboring nodes, or delegated to the Cloud based on the current nodes' context and statistical data relevance. We comprehensively evaluate our methodology demonstrating its applicability in edge computing environments.",

In this paper, we propose an AI-enabled multi-access edge computing (MEC) framework, supported by computing-equipped Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to facilitate IoT applications. Initially, the problem of determining the IoT nodes optimal data offloading strategies to the UAV-mounted MEC servers, while accounting for the IoT nodes\u2019 communication and computation overhead, is formulated based on a game-theoretic model. The existence of at least one Pure Nash Equilibrium (PNE) point is shown by proving that the game is submodular. Furthermore, different operation points (i.e. offloading strategies) are obtained and studied, based either on the outcome of Best Response Dynamics (BRD) algorithm, or via alternative reinforcement learning approaches (i.e. gradient ascent, log-linear, and Q-learning algorithms), which explore and learn the environment towards determining the users\u2019 stable data offloading strategies. The corresponding outcomes and inherent features of these approaches are critically compared against each other, via modeling and simulation.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract The global ambitions of a carbon-neutral society necessitate a stable and robust smart grid that capitalizes on frequency reserves of renewable energy. Frequency reserves are resources that adjust power production or consumption in real time to react to a power grid frequency deviation. Revenue generation motivates the availability of these resources for managing such deviations. However, limited research has been conducted on data-driven decisions and optimal bidding strategies for trading such capacities in multiple frequency reserves markets. We address this limitation by making the following research contributions. Firstly, a generalized model is designed based on an extensive study of critical characteristics of global frequency reserves markets. Secondly, three bidding strategies are proposed, based on this market model, to capitalize on price peaks in multi-stage markets. Two strategies are proposed for non-reschedulable loads, in which case the bidding strategy aims to select the market with the highest anticipated price, and the third bidding strategy focuses on rescheduling loads to hours on which highest reserve market prices are anticipated. The third research contribution is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based bidding optimization framework that implements these three strategies, with novel uncertainty metrics that supplement data-driven price prediction. Finally, the framework is evaluated empirically using a case study of multiple frequency reserves markets in Finland. The results from this evaluation confirm the effectiveness of the proposed bidding strategies and the AI-based bidding optimization framework in terms of cumulative revenue generation, leading to an increased availability of frequency reserves.",

            "paperAbstract": "\n Recent years have seen a rise of techniques based on artificial intelligence (AI). With that have also come initiatives for guidance on how to develop \u201cresponsible AI\u201d aligned with human and ethical values. Compared to sectors like energy, healthcare, or transportation, the use of AI-based techniques in the water domain is relatively modest. This paper presents a review of current AI applications in the water domain and develops some tentative insights as to what \u201cresponsible AI\u201d could mean there. Building on the reviewed literature, four categories of application are identified: modeling, prediction and forecasting, decision support and operational management, and optimization. We also identify three insights pertaining to the water sector in particular: the use of AI techniques in general, and many-objective optimization in particular, that allow for a pluralism of values and changing values; the use of theory-guided data science, which can avoid some of the pitfalls of strictly data-driven models; and the ability to build on experiences with participatory decision-making in the water sector. These insights suggest that the development and application of responsible AI techniques for the water sector should not be left to data scientists alone, but requires concerted effort by water professionals and data scientists working together, complemented with expertise from the social sciences and humanities.\n",

            "paperAbstract": "The applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in aiding clinical decision-making and management of stroke and heart diseases have become increasingly common in recent years, thanks in part to technological advancements and the heightened interest of the research and medical community. This study aims to provide a comprehensive picture of global trends and developments of AI applications relating to stroke and heart diseases, identifying research gaps and suggesting future directions for research and policy-making. A novel analysis approach that combined bibliometrics analysis with a more complex analysis of abstract content using exploratory factor analysis and Latent Dirichlet allocation, which uncovered emerging research domains and topics, was adopted. Data were extracted from the Web of Science database. Results showed topics with the most compelling growth to be AI for big data analysis, robotic prosthesis, robotics-assisted stroke rehabilitation, and minimally invasive surgery. The study also found an emerging landscape of research that was centered on population-specific and early detection of stroke and heart disease. Application of AI in health behavior tracking and improvement as well as the use of robotics in medical diagnostics and prognostication have also been found to attract significant research attention. In light of these findings, it is suggested that the currently under-researched issues of data management, AI model reliability, as well as validation of its clinical utility, need to be further explored in future research and policy decisions to maximize the benefits of AI applications in stroke and heart diseases.",

            "paperAbstract": "Purpose of review The use of computers has become increasingly relevant to medical decision-making, and artificial intelligence methods have recently demonstrated significant advances in medicine. We therefore provide an overview of current artificial intelligence methods and their applications, to help the practicing ophthalmologist understand their potential impact on glaucoma care. Recent findings Techniques used in artificial intelligence can successfully analyze and categorize data from visual fields, optic nerve structure [e.g., optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus photography], ocular biomechanical properties, and a combination thereof to identify disease severity, determine disease progression, and/or recommend referral for specialized care. Algorithms have become increasingly complex in recent years, utilizing both supervised and unsupervised methods of artificial intelligence. Impressive performance of these algorithms on previously unseen data has been reported, often outperforming standard global indices and expert observers. However, there remains no clearly defined gold standard for determining the presence and severity of glaucoma, which undermines the training of these algorithms. To improve upon existing methodologies, future work must employ more robust definitions of disease, optimize data inputs for artificial intelligence analysis, and improve methods of extracting knowledge from learned results. Summary Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize the screening, diagnosis, and classification of glaucoma, both through the automated processing of large data sets, and by earlier detection of new disease patterns. In addition, artificial intelligence holds promise for fundamentally changing research aimed at understanding the development, progression, and treatment of glaucoma, by identifying novel risk factors and by evaluating the importance of existing ones.",

Progress had historically languished in these areas, such that these skills had come to seem ineffably bound to intelligence. However, these commercial advances have performed best at single-task applications in which imperfect outputs and occasional frank errors can be tolerated.The practice of anesthesiology is different. It embodies a requirement for high reliability, and a pressured cycle of interpretation, physical action, and response rather than any single cognitive act. This review covers the basics of what is meant by artificial intelligence and machine learning for the practicing anesthesiologist, describing how decision-making behaviors can emerge from simple equations. Relevant clinical questions are introduced to illustrate how machine learning might help solve them-perhaps bringing anesthesiology into an era of machine-assisted discovery.",

            "paperAbstract": "Decision making is concerned with evaluating and/or ranking possible alternatives of action. In this paper, we develop a model for the process of decision making. Understanding the decision process can provide insights into how humans make decisions, understand their decision making approaches, and how they differ from each other. We believe that decision makers who are conscious of their decision process types can make more effective and balanced decisions. In this paper, we present a new decision process model based on the following four dimensions where each dimension is defined by two opposing types: Information Processing (Concrete and Abstract), Alternative Generation (Adaptive and Constructive), Alternative Evaluation (Moderate and Bold), and Decision Closure (Organized and Flexible). Furthermore, an approach for assessing each of the four decision process types by a mathematical function is presented. In a much boarder scope than decision making, these assessed functions can be used to evaluate and rank alternatives. The decision process model can also be used in conjunction with multiple criteria decision making and multiple objective optimization. The model can also be used to explain the reasons that the classical decision making models fail to describe real decision makers\u2019 behavior, and mistakenly label such behavior as irrational. The proposed decision process model can be used for developing new behavioral, rational, and intelligent decision making theories and approaches. Extensions of this work may include group decision making, organizational decision making, team formation, and risk behavior analysis. Experimental results of over four hundred engineering students are reported. A web site has been developed for users (http://car.cwru.edu/decision/).",

The goal is to analyse the distribution of data-driven AI approaches with respect to \u201cclassical\" knowledge-based ones, and to consider the issues raised and their possible solutions. Methods : We included PubMed and Web of Science TM publications, focusing on contributions describing clinical DSSs that adopted one or more AI methodologies. Results : We selected 75 papers, 49 of which describe approaches in the data-driven AI area, 20 present purely knowledge-based DSSs, and 6 adopt hybrid approaches relying on both formalized knowledge and data. Conclusions : Recent studies in the clinical DSS area demonstrate a prevalence of data-driven AI, which can be adopted autonomously in purely data-driven systems, or in cooperation with domain knowledge in hybrid systems. Such hybrid approaches, able to conjugate all available knowledge sources through proper knowledge integration steps, represent an interesting example of synergy between the two AI categories. This synergy can lead to the resolution of some existing issues, such as the need for transparency and explainability, nowadays recognized as central themes to be addressed by both AI and medical informatics research.",

According to the concept, the manufacturing includes three main units: equipment, personnel and processes. All data from these units are inherited to manufacture model (DT) and decision support system with the use of AI. DT data technology allows finding the required knowledge that can be interpreted and used to support the process of decision-making in the management of the enterprise. AI applications open up a broad spectrum of opportunities in manufacturing to add value by optimizing processes and generating new business models. The Landscape was described by a formal model to assure the possibility to analyze the state and development of landscape in detail considering DT and other technologies. DT and IIoT implementation for the simulation of real enterprise manufacturing were considered.",

            "paperAbstract": "Neurological disorders significantly outnumber diseases in other therapeutic areas. However, developing drugs for central nervous system (CNS) disorders remains the most challenging area in drug discovery, accompanied with the long timelines and high attrition rates. With the rapid growth of biomedical data enabled by advanced experimental technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as an indispensable tool to draw meaningful insights and improve decision making in drug discovery. Thanks to the advancements in AI and ML algorithms, now the AI/ML\u2010driven solutions have an unprecedented potential to accelerate the process of CNS drug discovery with better success rate. In this review, we comprehensively summarize AI/ML\u2010powered pharmaceutical discovery efforts and their implementations in the CNS area. After introducing the AI/ML models as well as the conceptualization and data preparation, we outline the applications of AI/ML technologies to several key procedures in drug discovery, including target identification, compound screening, hit/lead generation and optimization, drug response and synergy prediction, de novo drug design, and drug repurposing. We review the current state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art of AI/ML\u2010guided CNS drug discovery, focusing on blood\u2013brain barrier permeability prediction and implementation into therapeutic discovery for neurological diseases. Finally, we discuss the major challenges and limitations of current approaches and possible future directions that may provide resolutions to these difficulties.",

The latter term implies that computers support\u2014rather than replace\u2014human decision-making. It is unclear whether the terminology used affects attitudes and perceptions in practice. Methods In the context of a quality improvement project implementing AI/AHI-based decision support in a regional health system, we surveyed staff\u2019s attitudes about AI/AHI, randomizing question prompts to refer to either AI or AHI. Results Ninety-three staff completed surveys. With a power of 0.95 to detect a difference larger than 0.8 points on a 5-point scale, we did not detect a significant difference in responses to six questions regarding attitudes when respondents were alternatively asked about AI versus AHI (mean difference range: 0.04\u20130.22 points; p \u00a0>\u20090.05). Conclusion Although findings may be setting-specific, we observed that use of the terms \u201cAI\u201d and \u201cAHI\u201d in a survey on attitudes of clinical staff elicited similar responses.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly important for surgical decision making to help address diverse sources of information, such as patient risk factors, anatomy, disease natural history, patient values and cost, and assist surgeons and patients to make better predictions regarding the consequences of surgical decisions. In this review, we discuss the current initiatives that are using AI in cardiothoracic surgery and surgical care in general. We also address the future of AI and how high-tech ORs will leverage human-machine teaming to optimize performance and enhance patient safety.",

In the smart cities concept, ICT is playing a vital role in policy design, decision, implementation, and ultimate productive services. The primary objective of this review is to explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in the evolution of smart cities. The preceding techniques are efficiently used to design optimal policy regarding various smart city-oriented complex problems. In this survey, we present in-depth details of the applications of the prior techniques in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), cyber-security, energy-efficient utilization of smart grids (SGs), effective use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assure the best services of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) communications, and smart health care system in a smart city. Finally, we present various research challenges and future research directions where the aforementioned techniques can play an outstanding role to realize the concept of a smart city.",

Algorithms include neural networks (NN), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM). ML may generate substantial improvements in neurosurgery. This systematic review assessed the current state of neurosurgical ML applications and the performance of algorithms applied. Our systematic search strategy yielded 6866 results, 70 of which met inclusion criteria. Performance statistics analyzed included area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Natural language processing (NLP) was used to model topics across the corpus and to identify keywords within surgical subspecialties. ML applications were heterogeneous. The densest cluster of studies focused on preoperative evaluation, planning, and outcome prediction in spine surgery. The main algorithms applied were NN, LR, and SVM. Input and output features varied widely and were listed to facilitate future research. The accuracy (F(2,19)\u2009=\u20096.56, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and specificity (F(2,16)\u2009=\u20095.57, p\u2009<\u20090.01) of NN, LR, and SVM differed significantly. NN algorithms demonstrated significantly higher accuracy than LR. SVM demonstrated significantly higher specificity than LR. We found no significant difference between NN, LR, and SVM AUC and sensitivity. NLP topic modeling reached maximum coherence at seven topics, which were defined by modeling approach, surgery type, and pathology themes. Keywords captured research foci within surgical domains. ML technology accurately predicts outcomes and facilitates clinical decision-making in neurosurgery. NNs frequently outperformed other algorithms on supervised learning tasks. This study identified gaps in the literature and opportunities for future neurosurgical ML research.",

            "paperAbstract": "This essay highlights the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in governance and society and explores the relationship between AI, discretion, and bureaucracy. AI is an advanced information communication technology tool (ICT) that changes both the nature of human discretion within a bureaucracy and the structure of bureaucracies. To better understand this relationship, AI, discretion, and bureaucracy are explored in some detail. It is argued that discretion and decision-making are strongly influenced by intelligence, and that improvements in intelligence, such as those that can be found within the field of AI, can help improve the overall quality of administration. Furthermore, the characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of both human discretion and AI are explored. Once these characteristics are laid out, a further exploration of the role AI may play in bureaucracies and bureaucratic structure is presented, followed by a specific focus on systems-level bureaucracies. In addition, it is argued that task distribution and task characteristics play a large role, along with the organizational and legal context, in whether a task favors human discretion or the use of AI. Complexity and uncertainty are presented as the major defining characteristics for categorizing tasks. Finally, a discussion is provided about the important cautions and concerns of utilizing AI in governance, in particular, with respect to existential risk and administrative evil.",

            "paperAbstract": "The discipline of radiology and diagnostic imaging has evolved greatly in recent years. We have observed an exponential increase in the number of exams performed, subspecialization of medical fields, and increases in accuracy of the various imaging methods, making it a challenge for the radiologist to \u201cknow everything about all exams and regions\u201d. In addition, imaging exams are no longer only qualitative and diagnostic, providing now quantitative information on disease severity, as well as identifying biomarkers of prognosis and treatment response. In view of this, computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed with the objective of complementing diagnostic imaging and helping the therapeutic decision-making process. With the advent of artificial intelligence, \u201cbig data\u201d, and machine learning, we are moving toward the rapid expansion of the use of these tools in daily life of physicians, making each patient unique, as well as leading radiology toward the concept of multidisciplinary approach and precision medicine. In this article, we will present the main aspects of the computational tools currently available for analysis of images and the principles of such analysis, together with the main terms and concepts involved, as well as examining the impact that the development of artificial intelligence has had on radiology and diagnostic imaging.",

            "paperAbstract": "Growing populations, demographic changes, and a shortage of health practitioners have placed pressures on the health-care sector. In parallel, increasing amounts of digital health data and information have become available. Artificial intelligence (AI) models that learn from these large datasets are in development and have the potential to assist with pattern recognition and classification problems in medicine\u2014for example, early detection, diagnosis, and medical decision making. These advances promise to improve health care for patients and provide much-needed support for medical practitioners. Over the past decade, considerable resources have been allocated to exploring the use of AI for health. Although there is immense potential, many issues such as regulation, potential for bias, and adequate evaluation of efficacy must first be addressed for safe and ethical implementation of AI in health care. Modern AI algorithms are complex, and their performance depends on the quality of the training data and learning mechanism. If AI algorithms are poorly designed or the training data are biased or incomplete, errors can occur. There is no agreed framework for assessing or reporting the results of health AI models before deciding whether they are sufficiently robust for application in a population, as there is for new drugs or surgical interventions. The absence of confidence or quality control is a major barrier to the uptake of AI in health care. Creating a rigorous, standardised evaluation framework that leverages the advantages and addresses the limitations of AI models in health is crucial for realising the potential of this technology and limiting risks. Two UN agencies, WHO and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), established a Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H) in July, 2018. FG-AI4H is developing a benchmarking process for health AI models that can act as an international, independent, standard evaluation framework. To establish this evaluation and benchmarking process, FG-AI4H is calling for participation from medical, public health, AI, data analytics, and policy experts. Topic groups are being formed by communities of stakeholders allowing FG-AI4H to develop its processes for AI evaluation and benchmarking specific for each health topic. Each topic use case will be reviewed for its relevance and should impact a large and diverse part of the global population or solve a health problem that is difficult or expensive. The AI models are expected to offer improvements over current practices in quality or efficiency that would be expected to lead to better health outcomes or costeffectiveness. Once formed, topic groups will provide a forum for open collaboration among stakeholders who agree on a pragmatic, best-practice approach for benchmarking each use case, including defining the application scenario and desired output of AI models in that use case, identifying adequate sources of training and testing data, and facilitating the preparation of multisource heterogeneous data. All data for training and testing are expected to be of high quality, ethically generated, and accompanied by detailed information about their format and properties. Thus far, FG-AI4H has developed 11 topic groups in areas such as cardiovascular disease risk prediction, ophthalmology (retinal imaging diagnostics), and AI-based symptom checkers, but this approach is expected to be expanded to other tasks. The benchmarking process will be done on secure, confidential test data. Ideally, test data will originate from various sources to determine whether the use of an AI model can be generalised across different populations, measurement devices, and health-care settings. The benchmarking process for each use case within a topic needs to be defined. For many use cases it would, at least initially, be meaningful to compare model performance against human performance, or human performance with AI assistance in the same task, whereas for other tasks, comparative performance of algorithms would be more meaningful. Once these requirements are met, AI models can be submitted via an online platform to be evaluated with the test data. Established in this way, the benchmarking process will not only provide a reliable, robust, and independent evaluation system that can demonstrate the quality Published Online March 29, 2019 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/ S0140-6736(19)30762-7",

            "paperAbstract": "Summary Background : The rise of biomedical expert heuristic knowledge-based approaches for computational modeling and problem solving, for scientific inquiry and medical decision-making, and for consultation in the 1970\u2019s led to a major change in the paradigm that affected all of artificial intelligence (AI) research. Since then, AI has evolved, surviving several \u201cwinters\u201d, as it has oscillated between relying on expensive and hard-to-validate knowledge-based approaches, and the alternative of using machine learning methods for inferring classification rules from labelled datasets. In the past couple of decades, we are seeing a gradual but progressive intertwining of the two. Objectives : To give an overview of early directions in AI in medicine and threads of some subsequent developments motivated by the very different goals of scientific inquiry for biomedical research, and for computational modeling of clinical reasoning and more general healthcare problem solving from the perspective of today\u2019s \u201cAI-Deep Learning Boom\u201d. To show how, from the beginning, AI was central to Biomedical and Health Informatics (BMHI), as a field investigating how to understand intelligent thinking in dealing professionally with the practice for healthcare, developing mathematical models, technology, and software tools to aid human experts in biomedicine, despite many previous bouts of \u201cexuberant optimism\u201d about the methodologies deployed. Methods : An overview and commentary on some of the early research and publications in AI in biomedicine, emphasizing the different approaches to the modeling of problems involved in clinical practice in contrast to those of biomedical science. A concluding reflection of a few current challenges and pitfalls of AI in some biomedical applications. Conclusion : While biomedical knowledge-based systems played a critical role in influencing AI in its early days, 50 years later they have taken a back seat behind \u201cDeep Learning\u201d which promises to discover knowledge structures for inference and prediction, both in science and for clinical decision-support. Early work on AI for medical consultation turned out to be more useful for explanation and teaching than for clinical practice, as had been originally intended. Today, despite the many reported successes of deep learning, fundamental scientific challenges arise in drawing on models of brain science, cognition, and language, if AI is to augment and complement rather than replace human judgment and expertise in biomedicine while also incorporating these advances for translational medicine. Understanding clinical phenotypes and how they relate to precision and personalization of care requires not only scientific inquiry, but also humanistic models of treatment that respond to patient and practitioner narrative exchanges, since it is the stories and insights of human experts which encourage what Norbert Weiner termed the ethical \u201chuman use of human beings\u201d, so central to adherence to the Hippocratic Oath",

Many commentary articles published in the general public and health domains recognise that medical imaging is at the forefront of these changes due to our large digital data footprint. Radiomics is transforming medical images into mineable high\u2010dimensional data to optimise clinical decision\u2010making; however, some would argue that AI could infiltrate workplaces with very few ethical checks and balances. In this commentary article, we describe how AI is beginning to change medical imaging services and the innovations that are on the horizon. We explore how AI and its various forms, including machine learning, will challenge the way medical imaging is delivered from workflow, image acquisition, image registration to interpretation. Diagnostic radiographers will need to learn to work alongside our \u2018virtual colleagues\u2019, and we argue that there are vital changes to entry and advanced curricula together with national professional capabilities to ensure machine\u2010learning tools are used in the safest and most effective manner for our patients.",

            "paperAbstract": "Echocardiography has a central role in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease. Precise and reliable echocardiographic assessment is required for clinical decision-making. Even if the development of new technologies (3-dimentional echocardiography, speckle-tracking, semi-automated analysis, etc.), the final decision on analysis is strongly dependent on operator experience. Diagnostic errors are a major unresolved problem. Moreover, not only can cardiologists differ from one another in image interpretation, but also the same observer may come to different findings when a reading is repeated. Daily high workloads in clinical practice may lead to this error, and all cardiologists require precise perception in this field. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve analysis and interpretation of medical images to a new stage compared with previous algorithms. From our comprehensive review, we believe AI has the potential to improve accuracy of diagnosis, clinical management, and patient care. Although there are several concerns about the required large dataset and \"black box\" algorithm, AI can provide satisfactory results in this field. In the future, it will be necessary for cardiologists to adapt their daily practice to incorporate AI in this new stage of echocardiography.",

Machine learning (ML) is a form of narrow artificial intelligence which can be used to automate decision making and make predictions based upon patient data.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nThis review outlines key applications of supervised and unsupervised machine learning in musculoskeletal medicine; such as diagnostic imaging, patient measurement data, and clinical decision support. The current literature base is examined to identify areas where ML performs equal to or more accurately than human levels.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS\nPotential is apparent for intelligent machines to enhance various areas of physiotherapy practice through automization of tasks which involve data analysis, classification and prediction. Changes to service provision through applications of ML, should encourage physiotherapists to increase their awareness of and experiences with emerging technologies. Data literacy should be a component of professional development plans to assist physiotherapists in the application of ML and the preparation of information technology systems to use these techniques.",

            "paperAbstract": "Importance\nThe use of artificial intelligence (AI) is expanding throughout the field of medicine. In dermatology, researchers are evaluating the potential for direct-to-patient and clinician decision-support AI tools to classify skin lesions. Although AI is poised to change how patients engage in health care, patient perspectives remain poorly understood.\n\n\nObjective\nTo explore how patients conceptualize AI and perceive the use of AI for skin cancer screening.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nA qualitative study using a grounded theory approach to semistructured interview analysis was conducted in general dermatology clinics at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and melanoma clinics at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Forty-eight patients were enrolled. Each interview was independently coded by 2 researchers with interrater reliability measurement; reconciled codes were used to assess code frequency. The study was conducted from May 6 to July 8, 2019.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nArtificial intelligence concept, perceived benefits and risks of AI, strengths and weaknesses of AI, AI implementation, response to conflict between human and AI clinical decision-making, and recommendation for or against AI.\n\n\nResults\nOf 48 patients enrolled, 26 participants (54%) were women; mean (SD) age was 53.3 (21.7) years. Sixteen patients (33%) had a history of melanoma, 16 patients (33%) had a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer only, and 16 patients (33%) had no history of skin cancer. Twenty-four patients were interviewed about a direct-to-patient AI tool and 24 patients were interviewed about a clinician decision-support AI tool. Interrater reliability ratings for the 2 coding teams were \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.94 and \u03ba\u2009=\u20090.89. Patients primarily conceptualized AI in terms of cognition. Increased diagnostic speed (29 participants [60%]) and health care access (29 [60%]) were the most commonly perceived benefits of AI for skin cancer screening; increased patient anxiety was the most commonly perceived risk (19 [40%]). Patients perceived both more accurate diagnosis (33 [69%]) and less accurate diagnosis (41 [85%]) to be the greatest strength and weakness of AI, respectively. The dominant theme that emerged was the importance of symbiosis between humans and AI (45 [94%]). Seeking biopsy was the most common response to conflict between human and AI clinical decision-making (32 [67%]). Overall, 36 patients (75%) would recommend AI to family members and friends.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this qualitative study, patients appeared to be receptive to the use of AI for skin cancer screening if implemented in a manner that preserves the integrity of the human physician-patient relationship.",

            "paperAbstract": "BackgroundPrognosticating the course of diseases to inform decision-making is a key component of intensive care medicine. For several applications in medicine, new methods from the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have already outperformed conventional prediction models. Due to their technical characteristics, these methods will present new ethical challenges to the intensivist.ResultsIn addition to the standards of data stewardship in medicine, the selection of datasets and algorithms to create AI prognostication models must involve extensive scrutiny to avoid biases and, consequently, injustice against individuals or groups of patients. Assessment of these models for compliance with the ethical principles of beneficence and non-maleficence should also include quantification of predictive uncertainty. Respect for patients\u2019 autonomy during decision-making requires transparency of the data processing by AI models to explain the predictions derived from these models. Moreover, a system of continuous oversight can help to maintain public trust in this technology. Based on these considerations as well as recent guidelines, we propose a pathway to an ethical implementation of AI-based prognostication. It includes a checklist for new AI models that deals with medical and technical topics as well as patient- and system-centered issues.ConclusionAI models for prognostication will become valuable tools in intensive care. However, they require technical refinement and a careful implementation according to the standards of medical ethics.",

            "paperAbstract": "Observer-driven pattern recognition is the standard for interpretation of medical images. To achieve global parity in interpretation, semi-quantitative scoring systems have been developed based on observer assessments; these are widely used in scoring coronary artery disease, the arthritides and neurological conditions and for indicating the likelihood of malignancy. However, in an era of machine learning and artificial intelligence, it is increasingly desirable that we extract quantitative biomarkers from medical images that inform on disease detection, characterisation, monitoring and assessment of response to treatment. Quantitation has the potential to provide objective decision-support tools in the management pathway of patients. Despite this, the quantitative potential of imaging remains under-exploited because of variability of the measurement, lack of harmonised systems for data acquisition and analysis, and crucially, a paucity of evidence on how such quantitation potentially affects clinical decision-making and patient outcome. This article reviews the current evidence for the use of semi-quantitative and quantitative biomarkers in clinical settings at various stages of the disease pathway including diagnosis, staging and prognosis, as well as predicting and detecting treatment response. It critically appraises current practice and sets out recommendations for using imaging objectively to drive patient management decisions.",

            "title": "Artificial intelligence in abdominal aortic aneurysm.",
            "paperAbstract": "OBJECTIVE\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening disease, and the only curative treatment relies on open or endovascular repair. The decision to treat relies on the evaluation of the risk of AAA growth and rupture, which can be difficult to assess in practice. Artificial intelligence (AI) has revealed new insights into the management of cardiovascular diseases, but its application in AAA has so far been poorly described. The aim of this review was to summarize the current knowledge on the potential applications of AI in patients with AAA.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA comprehensive literature review was performed. The MEDLINE database was searched according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The search strategy used a combination of keywords and included studies using AI in patients with AAA published between May 2019 and January 2000. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts and performed data extraction. The search of published literature identified 34 studies with distinct methodologies, aims, and study designs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAI was used in patients with AAA to improve image segmentation and for quantitative analysis and characterization of AAA morphology, geometry, and fluid dynamics. AI allowed computation of large data sets to identify patterns that may be predictive of AAA growth and rupture. Several predictive and prognostic programs were also developed to assess patients' postoperative outcomes, including mortality and complications after endovascular aneurysm repair.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAI represents a useful tool in the interpretation and analysis of AAA imaging by enabling automatic quantitative measurements and morphologic characterization. It could be used to help surgeons in preoperative planning. AI-driven data management may lead to the development of computational programs for the prediction of AAA evolution and risk of rupture as well as postoperative outcomes. AI could also be used to better evaluate the indications and types of surgical treatment and to plan the postoperative follow-up. AI represents an attractive tool for decision-making and may facilitate development of personalized therapeutic approaches for patients with AAA.",

In this paper, we explore the techniques that have been applied to the challenges within team sports thus far. We focus on a number of different areas, namely match outcome prediction, tactical decision making, player investments, fantasy sports, and injury prediction. By assessing the work in these areas, we explore how AI is used to predict match outcomes and to help sports teams improve their strategic and tactical decision making. In particular, we describe the main directions in which research efforts have been focused to date. This highlights not only a number of strengths but also weaknesses of the models and techniques that have been employed. Finally, we discuss the research questions that exist in order to further the use of AI and ML in team sports.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract Predicting demand in emergency medical services is crucial for saving people's lives. Most studies aggregate demand prediction within a zone, failing to offer insights at a more detailed level. This study aspires to fill this gap by introducing a novel, three-level, spatial-based approach that identifies the geographical location of expected emergency events. First, the proposed methodology introduces new concepts and notions to model emergency events, as sets of interconnected points in space, that create paths over time. Second, based on these paths, an artificial neural network, optimized using a new evolutionary algorithm, predicts the location of future demand (emergencies). Third, based on the predicted demand, a location-allocation model is applied to site ambulances prior to actual emergencies occurrence, enhancing thus location planning and decision making. This method is applied to a dataset comprising 2851 emergency events in Athens, Greece, and the outcomes are evaluated based on the actual emergency events occurred. Results show that the mean distance, between an actual emergency event and the nearest ambulance, located based on the expected demand as estimated by our approach, deviates by 110\u202fm relative to the optimal solution. This deviation, adds only a few seconds of delay to the response time of an ambulance relative to the theoretically optimal solution (post hoc location). In addition, it improves the current solution (in which ambulances are waiting in a set of fixed location throughout the year), by >1\u202fkm, decreasing significantly response time. From a policy perspective, these results indicate that assessing expected emergency events through the proposed method, would allow medical services to optimally locate ambulances in advance, reducing response time and thus increasing survival rates and public safety.",

            "title": "Autonomous Vehicles and Embedded Artificial Intelligence: The Challenges of Framing Machine Driving Decisions",
            "paperAbstract": "ABSTRACT With the advent of autonomous vehicles society will need to confront a new set of risks which, for the first time, includes the ability of socially embedded forms of artificial intelligence to make complex risk mitigation decisions: decisions that will ultimately engender tangible life and death consequences. Since AI decisionality is inherently different to human decision-making processes, questions are therefore raised regarding how AI weighs decisions, how we are to mediate these decisions, and what such decisions mean in relation to others. Therefore, society, policy, and end-users, need to fully understand such differences. While AI decisions can be contextualised to specific meanings, significant challenges remain in terms of the technology of AI decisionality, the conceptualisation of AI decisions, and the extent to which various actors understand them. This is particularly acute in terms of analysing the benefits and risks of AI decisions. Due to the potential safety benefits, autonomous vehicles are often presented as significant risk mitigation technologies. There is also a need to understand the potential new risks which autonomous vehicle driving decisions may present. Such new risks are framed as decisional limitations in that artificial driving intelligence will lack certain decisional capacities. This is most evident in the inability to annotate and categorise the driving environment in terms of human values and moral understanding. In both cases there is a need to scrutinise how autonomous vehicle decisional capacity is conceptually framed and how this, in turn, impacts a wider grasp of the technology in terms of risks and benefits. This paper interrogates the significant shortcomings in the current framing of the debate, both in terms of safety discussions and in consideration of AI as a moral actor, and offers a number of ways forward.",

            "paperAbstract": "The clinical team attending to a patient upon a diagnosis is faced with two main questions: what treatment, and at what dose? Clinical trials\u2019 results provide the basis for guidance and support for official protocols that clinicians use to base their decisions upon. However, individuals rarely demonstrate the reported response from relevant clinical trials, often the average from a group representing a population or subpopulation. The decision complexity increases with combination treatments where drugs administered together can interact with each other, which is often the case. Additionally, the individual\u2019s response to the treatment varies over time with the changes in his or her condition, whether via the indication or physiology. In practice, the drug and the dose selection depend greatly on the medical protocol of the healthcare provider and the medical team\u2019s experience. As such, the results are inherently varied and often suboptimal. Big data approaches have emerged as an excellent decision-making support tool, but their application is limited by multiple challenges, the main one being the availability of sufficiently big datasets with good quality, representative information. An alternative approach\u2014phenotypic personalized medicine (PPM)\u2014finds an appropriate drug combination (quadratic phenotypic optimization platform [QPOP]) and an appropriate dosing strategy over time (CURATE.AI) based on small data collected exclusively from the treated individual. PPM-based approaches have demonstrated superior results over the current standard of care.

            "paperAbstract": "One of the trends in the decision-making field in the past 20 years has been the migration from individual decision-making to collective one. Several changes of working conditions influenced this trend: geographical dispersion due to the business internationalisation, concurrent work in order to satisfy time delays, facilitation of the information sharing induced by the development of local area networks (LAN), and internet. This study examines the discrepancies and analogies in addressing the collaborative decision making in two scientific fields: artificial intelligence and engineering design. These two fields have different considerations and approaches in view to the decision-making support. This paper exposes a comparative study concerning two research studies, both decision support oriented: the first one concerns the collaborative decision-making in early design stages in vehicle development projects (Jankovic, Bocquet, Stal Le Cardinal, & Bavoux, 2006) and the second one concerns the development of an architecture of a Cooperative decision Support Systems (CDSS) (ZaratA\u00a9, 2005).",

In particular, evidence suggests that current practices in the administration of intravenous fluids and vasopressors are suboptimal and likely induce harm in a proportion of patients1,4\u20136. To tackle this sequential decision-making problem, we developed a reinforcement learning agent, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Clinician, which extracted implicit knowledge from an amount of patient data that exceeds by many-fold the life-time experience of human clinicians and learned optimal treatment by analyzing a myriad of (mostly suboptimal) treatment decisions. We demonstrate that the value of the AI Clinician\u2019s selected treatment is on average reliably higher than human clinicians. In a large validation cohort independent of the training data, mortality was lowest in patients for whom clinicians\u2019 actual doses matched the AI decisions. Our model provides individualized and clinically interpretable treatment decisions for sepsis that could improve patient outcomes.A reinforcement learning agent, the AI Clinician, can assist physicians by providing individualized and clinically interpretable treatment decisions to improve patient outcomes.",

            "paperAbstract": "Creating impact in real-world settings requires artificial intelligence techniques to span the full pipeline from data, to predictive models, to decisions. These components are typically approached separately: a machine learning model is first trained via a measure of predictive accuracy, and then its predictions are used as input into an optimization algorithm which produces a decision. However, the loss function used to train the model may easily be misaligned with the end goal, which is to make the best decisions possible. Hand-tuning the loss function to align with optimization is a difficult and error-prone process (which is often skipped entirely).We focus on combinatorial optimization problems and introduce a general framework for decision-focused learning, where the machine learning model is directly trained in conjunction with the optimization algorithm to produce highquality decisions. Technically, our contribution is a means of integrating common classes of discrete optimization problems into deep learning or other predictive models, which are typically trained via gradient descent. The main idea is to use a continuous relaxation of the discrete problem to propagate gradients through the optimization procedure. We instantiate this framework for two broad classes of combinatorial problems: linear programs and submodular maximization. Experimental results across a variety of domains show that decisionfocused learning often leads to improved optimization performance compared to traditional methods. We find that standard measures of accuracy are not a reliable proxy for a predictive model\u2019s utility in optimization, and our method\u2019s ability to specify the true goal as the model\u2019s training objective yields substantial dividends across a range of decision problems.",

            "paperAbstract": "The main purpose of our study is to analyze the influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on firm performance, notably by building on the business value of AI-based transformation projects. This study was conducted using a four-step sequential approach: (1) analysis of AI and AI concepts/technologies; (2) in-depth exploration of case studies from a great number of industrial sectors; (3) data collection from the databases (websites) of AI-based solution providers; and (4) a review of AI literature to identify their impact on the performance of organizations while highlighting the business value of AI-enabled projects transformation within organizations.,This study has called on the theory of IT capabilities to seize the influence of AI business value on firm performance (at the organizational and process levels). The research process (responding to the research question, making discussions, interpretations and comparisons, and formulating recommendations) was based on a review of 500 case studies from IBM, AWS, Cloudera, Nvidia, Conversica, Universal Robots websites, etc. Studying the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and more specifically, of the business value of such organizations\u2019 AI-enabled transformation projects, required us to make an archival data analysis following the three steps, namely the conceptual phase, the refinement and development phase, and the assessment phase.,AI covers a wide range of technologies, including machine translation, chatbots and self-learning algorithms, all of which can allow individuals to better understand their environment and act accordingly. Organizations have been adopting AI technological innovations with a view to adapting to or disrupting their ecosystem while developing and optimizing their strategic and competitive advantages. AI fully expresses its potential through its ability to optimize existing processes and improve automation, information and transformation effects, but also to detect, predict and interact with humans. Thus, the results of our study have highlighted such AI benefits in organizations, and more specifically, its ability to improve on performance at both the organizational (financial, marketing and administrative) and process levels. By building on these AI attributes, organizations can, therefore, enhance the business value of their transformed projects. The same results also showed that organizations achieve performance through AI capabilities only when they use their features/technologies to reconfigure their processes.,AI obviously influences the way businesses are done today. Therefore, practitioners and researchers need to consider AI as a valuable support or even a pilot for a new business model. For the purpose of our study, we adopted a research framework geared toward a more inclusive and comprehensive approach so as to better account for the intangible benefits of AI within organizations. In terms of interest, this study nurtures a scientific interest, which aims at proposing a model for analyzing the influence of AI on the performance of organizations, and at the same time, filling the associated gap in the literature. As for the managerial interest, our study aims to provide managers with elements to be reconfigured or added in order to take advantage of the full benefits of AI, and therefore improve organizations\u2019 performance, the profitability of their investments in AI transformation projects, and some competitive advantage. This study also allows managers to consider AI not as a single technology but as a set/combination of several different configurations of IT in the various company\u2019s business areas because multiple key elements must be brought together to ensure the success of AI: data, talent mix, domain knowledge, key decisions, external partnerships and scalable infrastructure.,This article analyses case studies on the reuse of secondary data from AI deployment reports in organizations. The transformation of projects based on the use of AI focuses mainly on business process innovations and indirectly on those occurring at the organizational level. Thus, 500 case studies are being examined to provide significant and tangible evidence about the business value of AI-based projects and the impact of AI on firm performance. More specifically, this article, through these case studies, exposes the influence of AI at both the organizational and process performance levels, while considering it not as a single technology but as a set/combination of the several different configurations of IT in various industries.",

            "paperAbstract": "BackgroundCollective intelligence, facilitated by information technology or manual techniques, refers to the collective insight of groups working on a task and has the potential to generate more accurate information or decisions than individuals can make alone. This concept is gaining traction in healthcare and has potential in enhancing diagnostic accuracy. We aim to characterize the current state of research with respect to collective intelligence in medical decision-making and describe a framework for diverse studies in this topic.MethodsFor this systematic scoping review, we conducted a systematic search for published literature using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL on August 8, 2017. We included studies that combined the insights of two or more medical experts to make decisions related to patient care. Studies that examined medical decisions such as diagnosis, treatment, and management in the context of an actual or theoretical patient case were included. We include studies of complex medical decision-making rather than identification of a visual finding, as in radiology or pathology. We differentiate between medical decisions, in which synthesis of multiple types of information is required over time, and studies of radiological scans or pathological specimens, in which objective identification of a visual finding is performed. Two reviewers performed article screening, data extraction, and final inclusion for analysis.ResultsOf 3303 original articles, 15 were included. Each study examined the medical decisions of two or more individuals; however, studies were heterogeneous in their methods and outcomes. We present a framework to characterize these diverse studies, and future investigations, based on how they operationalize collective intelligence for medical decision-making: 1) how the initial decision task was completed (group vs. individual), 2) how opinions were synthesized (information technology vs. manual vs. in-person), and 3) the availability of collective intelligence to participants.DiscussionCollective intelligence in medical decision-making is gaining popularity to advance medical decision-making and holds promise to improve patient outcomes.

            "paperAbstract": "The progress in the research of various areas of robotics, artificial intelligence, and other similar scientific disciplines enabled the application of multi-robot systems in different complex environments and situations. It is necessary to elaborate the strategies regarding the path planning and paths coordination well in order to efficiently execute a global mission in common environment, prior to everything. This paper considers the multi-robot system based on the cloud technology with a high level of autonomy, which is intended for execution of tasks in a complex and crowded environment. Cloud approach shifts computation load from agents to the cloud and provides powerful processing capabilities to the multi-robot system. The proposed concept uses a multi-robot path planning algorithm that can operate in an environment that is unknown in advance. With the aim of improving the efficiency of path planning, the implementation of Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) while using Full consistency method (FUCOM) is proposed. FUCOM guarantees the consistent determination of the weights of factors affecting the robots motion to be symmetric or asymmetric, with respect to the mission specificity that requires the management of multiple risks arising from different sources, optimizing the global cost map in that way.",

There is, however, surprisingly little empirical research on the performance of group decision making related to the environment. We examined examples from a range of different disciplines, demonstrating the emergence of collective intelligence (CI) in the elicitation of quantitative estimates, crowdsourcing applications, and small-group problem solving. We explored the extent to which similar tools are used in environmental decision making. This revealed important gaps (e.g., a lack of integration of fundamental research in decision-making practice, absence of systematic evaluation frameworks) that obstruct mainstreaming of CI. By making judicious use of interdisciplinary learning opportunities, CI can be harnessed effectively to improve decision making in conservation and environmental management. To elicit reliable quantitative estimates an understanding of cognitive psychology and to optimize crowdsourcing artificial intelligence tools may need to be incorporated. The business literature offers insights into the importance of soft skills and diversity in team effectiveness. Environmental problems set a challenging and rich testing ground for collective-intelligence tools and frameworks. We argue this creates an opportunity for significant advancement in decision-making research and practice.",

Technological advancements have resulted in the permeation of similar systems into medical practice.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nBoth artificial intelligence and augmented reality are being increasingly incorporated into the practice of modern medicine to optimize decision making and ultimately improve patient outcomes.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nArtificial intelligence has already been incorporated into many areas of medical practice but has been slow to catch on in clinical gynecology. However, several applications of augmented reality are currently in use in gynecologic surgery. We present an overview of artificial intelligence and augmented reality and current use in medical practice with a focus on gynecology.",

            "paperAbstract": "Lean processes focus on doing only necessery things in an efficient way. Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning offer new opportunities to optimizing processes. The presented approach demonstrates an improvement of the test process by using Machine Learning as a support tool for test management. The scope is the semi-automation of the selection of regression tests. The proposed lean testing process uses Machine Learning as a supporting machine, while keeping the human test manager in charge of the adequate test case selection. 1 Introduction Many established long running projects and programs are execute regression tests during the release tests. The regression tests are the part of the release test to ensure that functionality from past releases still works fine in the new release. In many projects, a significant part of these regression tests are not automated and therefore executed manually. Manual tests are expensive and time intensive [1], which is why often only a relevant subset of all possible regression tests are executed in order to safe time and money. Depending on the software process, different approaches can be used to identify the right set of regression tests. The source code file level is a frequent entry point for this identification [2]. Advanced approaches combine different file level methods [3]. To handle black-box tests, methods like [4] or [5] can be used for test case prioritiza-tion. To decide which tests can be skipped, a relevance ranking of the tests in a regression test suite is needed. Based on the relevance a test is in or out of the regression test set for a specific release. This decision is a task of the test manager supported by experts. The task can be time-consuming in case of big (often a 4-to 5-digit number) regression test suites because the selection is specific to each release. Trends are going to continuous prioritization [6], which this work wants to support with the presented ML based approach for black box regression test case prioritization. Any regression test selection is made upon release specific changes. Changes can be new or deleted code based on refactoring or implementation of new features. But also changes on externals systems which are connected by interfaces have to be considered",

            "paperAbstract": "Background Artificial intelligence methods in combination with the latest technologies, including medical devices, mobile computing, and sensor technologies, have the potential to enable the creation and delivery of better management services to deal with chronic diseases. One of the most lethal and prevalent chronic diseases is diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by dysfunction of glucose homeostasis. Objective The objective of this paper is to review recent efforts to use artificial intelligence techniques to assist in the management of diabetes, along with the associated challenges. Methods A review of the literature was conducted using PubMed and related bibliographic resources. Analyses of the literature from 2010 to 2018 yielded 1849 pertinent articles, of which we selected 141 for detailed review. Results We propose a functional taxonomy for diabetes management and artificial intelligence. Additionally, a detailed analysis of each subject category was performed using related key outcomes. This approach revealed that the experiments and studies reviewed yielded encouraging results. Conclusions We obtained evidence of an acceleration of research activity aimed at developing artificial intelligence-powered tools for prediction and prevention of complications associated with diabetes. Our results indicate that artificial intelligence methods are being progressively established as suitable for use in clinical daily practice, as well as for the self-management of diabetes. Consequently, these methods provide powerful tools for improving patients\u2019 quality of life.",

            "paperAbstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) research within medicine is growing rapidly. In 2016, healthcare AI projects attracted more investment than AI projects within any other sector of the global economy.1 However, among the excitement, there is equal scepticism, with some urging caution at inflated expectations.2 This article takes a close look at current trends in medical AI and the future possibilities for general practice.\n\nInforming clinical decision making through insights from past data is the essence of evidence-based medicine. Traditionally, statistical methods have approached this task by characterising patterns within data as mathematical equations, for example, linear regression suggests a \u2018line of best fit\u2019. Through \u2018machine learning\u2019 (ML), AI provides techniques that uncover complex associations which cannot easily be reduced to an equation. For example, neural networks represent data through vast numbers of interconnected neurones in a similar fashion to the human brain. This allows ML systems to approach complex problem solving just as a clinician might \u2014 by carefully weighing evidence to reach reasoned conclusions. However, unlike a single clinician, these systems can simultaneously observe and rapidly process an almost limitless number of inputs. For example, an AI-driven smartphone app now capably handles the task of triaging 1.2 million people in North London to Accident & Emergency (A&E).3 Furthermore, these systems are able to learn from each incremental case and can be exposed, within minutes, to more cases than a clinician could see in many lifetimes. This is why an AI-driven application is able to \u2026",

We propose aLYNX concept that is a possibility to use an artificial intelligence algorithm or a neural network model in decision-making system so as to avoid possible mistakes and to remind the doctors to review tactics once more in selected cases. Method aLYNX system includes: registry with significant factors, decisions and results; machine learning process based on this registry data; the use of the machine learning results as the adviser. We show a possibility to build a computer adviser with a neural network model for making a choice between coronary aortic bypass surgery (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in order to achieve a higher 5-year survival rate in patients with angina based on the experience of 5107 patients. Results The neural network was trained by 4679 patients who achieved 5-year survival. Among them, 2390 patients underwent PCI and 2289 CABG. After training, the correlation coefficient (r) of the network was 0.74 for training, 0.67 for validation, 0.71 for test and 0.73 for total. Simulation of the neural network function has been performed after training in the two groups of patients with known 5-year outcome. The disagreement rate was significantly higher in the dead patient group than that in the survivor group between neural network model and heart team [16.8% (787/4679) vs. 20.3% (87/428), P = 0.065)]. Conclusion The study shows the possibility to build a computer adviser with a neural network model for making a choice between CABG and PCI in order to achieve a higher 5-year survival rate in patients with angina.",

            "paperAbstract": "A neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) provides critical services to preterm and high-risk infants. Over the years, many tools and techniques have been introduced to support the clinical decisions made by specialists in the NICU. This study systematically reviewed the different technologies used in neonatal decision support systems (DSS), including cognitive analysis, artificial neural networks, data mining techniques, multi-agent systems, and highlighted their role in patient diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, and healthcare management. Articles on NICU DSS were surveyed, Searches were based on the PubMed, Science Direct, and IEEE databases and only English articles published after 1990 were included. The overall search strategy was to retrieve articles that included terms that were related to \u201cNICU Decision Support Systems\u201d or \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d and \u201cNeonatal\u201d. Different methods and artificial intelligence techniques used in NICU decision support systems were assessed and related outcomes, variables, methods and performance measures was reported and discussed. Because of the dynamic, heterogeneous, and real-time environment of the NICU, the processes and medical rules that are followed within a NICU are complicated, and the data records that are produced are complex and frequent. Therefore, a single tool or technology could not cover all the needs of a NICU. However, it is important to examine and deploy new temporal data mining approaches and system architectures, such as multi-agent systems, services, and sensors, to provide integrated real-time solutions for NICU.",

            "paperAbstract": "Evoking strength is one of the important contributions of the field of Biomedical Informatics to the discipline of Artificial Intelligence. The University at Buffalo's Orthopedics Department wanted to create an expert system to assist patients with self-diagnosis of knee problems and to thereby facilitate referral to the right orthopedic subspecialist. They had two independent sports medicine physicians review 469 cases. A board-certified orthopedic sports medicine practitioner, L.B., reviewed any disagreements until a gold standard diagnosis was reached. For each case, the patients entered 126 potential answers to 26 questions into a Web interface. These were modeled by an expert sports medicine physician and the answers were reviewed by L.B. For each finding, the clinician specified the sensitivity (term frequency) and both specificity (Sp) and the heuristic evoking strength (ES). Heuristics are methods of reasoning with only partial evidence. An expert system was constructed that reflected the posttest odds of disease-ranked list for each case. We compare the accuracy of using Sp to that of using ES (original model, p\u2009<\u20090.0008; term importance * disease importance [DItimesTI] model, p\u2009<\u20090.0001: Wilcoxon ranked sum test). For patient referral assignment, Sp in the DItimesTI model was superior to the use of ES. By the fifth diagnosis, the advantage was lost and so there is no difference between the techniques when serving as a reminder system.",

This paper proposes the creation of a smart healthcare system using artificial intelligence as a means of efficiently solving challenges in the healthcare industry and as a tool for optimizing patient care plans. The proposed AI-assisted system shows that it can support a patient who is admitted to the hospital through emergency medical services, easily process the patient\u2019s data, and offer early detection of serious diseases. It can automatically recognize the complicated patterns which have been obtained from radiologists, can analyze complete human molecular data and genetics in the clinic, and can support doctors by producing AI-generated radiologist reports, clinical laboratory reports, and many other decision-support tools. The proposed architecture can easily handle diverse and complicated healthcare problems and can be used by any modern hospital to save time and money. This work also shows the recent development of AI applications in healthcare, which could be used in the proposed architecture.",

            "paperAbstract": "Self-driving vehicle is a popular and promising field in artificial intelligence. Conventional architecture consists of multiple sensors, which work collaboratively to sense the units on road to yield a precise and safe driving strategy. Besides the precision and safety, the quickness of decision is also a major concern. In order to react quickly, the vehicle need to predict its next possible action, such as acceleration, brake and steering angle, according to its latest few actions and status. In this paper, we treat this decision-making problem as a regression problem and use deep gaussian process to predict its next action. The regression model is trained using simulation data sets and accurately captures the most significant features. Combined with rule-based method, it can be used in Torcs simulation engine to realize successful loop trip on virtual roads. The proposed method outperforms the existing reinforcement learning methods on the performance indicators of time consumption and the size of data volume. It may be useful for real road tests in the future.",

            "paperAbstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) research within medicine is growing rapidly. In 2016, healthcare AI projects attracted more investment than AI projects within any other sector of the global economy.1 However, among the excitement, there is equal scepticism, with some urging caution at inflated expectations.2 This article takes a close look at current trends in medical AI and the future possibilities for general practice.\n\nInforming clinical decision making through insights from past data is the essence of evidence-based medicine. Traditionally, statistical methods have approached this task by characterising patterns within data as mathematical equations, for example, linear regression suggests a \u2018line of best fit\u2019. Through \u2018machine learning\u2019 (ML), AI provides techniques that uncover complex associations which cannot easily be reduced to an equation. For example, neural networks represent data through vast numbers of interconnected neurones in a similar fashion to the human brain. This allows ML systems to approach complex problem solving just as a clinician might \u2014 by carefully weighing evidence to reach reasoned conclusions. However, unlike a single clinician, these systems can simultaneously observe and rapidly process an almost limitless number of inputs. For example, an AI-driven smartphone app now capably handles the task of triaging 1.2 million people in North London to Accident & Emergency (A&E).3 Furthermore, these systems are able to learn from each incremental case and can be exposed, within minutes, to more cases than a clinician could see in many lifetimes. This is why an AI-driven application is able to \u2026",

Within the AI research community, this topic remains less familiar to many researchers. In this paper, we complement existing surveys, which largely focused on the psychological, social and legal discussions of the topic, with an analysis of recent advances in technical solutions for AI governance. By reviewing publications in leading AI conferences including AAAI, AAMAS, ECAI and IJCAI, we propose a taxonomy which divides the field into four areas: 1) exploring ethical dilemmas; 2) individual ethical decision frameworks; 3) collective ethical decision frameworks; and 4) ethics in human-AI interactions. We highlight the intuitions and key techniques used in each approach, and discuss promising future research directions towards successful integration of ethical AI systems into human societies.",

            "paperAbstract": "Covering based multigranulation rough fuzzy set, as a generalization of granular computing and covering based rough fuzzy set theory, is a vital tool for dealing with the vagueness and multigranularity in artificial intelligence and management sciences. By means of neighborhoods, we introduce two types of coverings based (optimistic, pessimistic and variable precision) multigranulation rough fuzzy set models, respectively. Some axiomatic systems are also obtained. The relationships between two types of coverings based (optimistic, pessimistic and variable precision) multigranulation rough fuzzy set models are established. Based on the theoretical discussion for the covering based multigranulation rough fuzzy set models, we present an approach to multiple criteria group decision making problem. These two types of basic models and the procedure of decision making methods as well as the algorithm for the new approach are given in detail. By comparative analysis, the ranking results based on two different models have a highly consensus. Although there exist some different ranking results on these two methods, the optimal selected alternative is the same.",

            "paperAbstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0has the potential to ease the human resources crisis in healthcare by facilitating diagnostics, decision-making, big data analytics and administration, among others. For this we must first tackle the technological, ethical and legal obstacles.The human resource crisis is widening worldwide, and it is obvious that it is not possible to provide care without workforce. How can disruptive technologies in healthcare help solve the variety of human resource problems? Will technology empower physicians or replace them? How can the medical curriculum, including post-graduate education prepare professionals for the meaningful use of technology? These questions have been growing for decades, and the promise of disruptive technologies filling them is imminent with digital health becoming widespread. Authors of this essay argue that AI might not only fill the human resources gap, but also raises ethical questions we need to deal with today.While there are even more questions to address, our stand is that AI is not meant to replace caregivers, but those who use AI will probably replace those who don\u2019t. And it is possible to prepare for that.",

Few previous studies have investigated this topic from a multi-disciplinary perspective, including accounting, business and management, decision sciences and health professions. Methods The structured literature review with its reliable and replicable research protocol allowed the researchers to extract 288 peer-reviewed papers from Scopus. The authors used qualitative and quantitative variables to analyse authors, journals, keywords, and collaboration networks among researchers. Additionally, the paper benefited from the Bibliometrix R software package. Results The investigation showed that the literature in this field is emerging. It focuses on health services management, predictive medicine, patient data and diagnostics, and clinical decision-making. The United States, China, and the United Kingdom contributed the highest number of studies. Keyword analysis revealed that AI can support physicians in making a diagnosis, predicting the spread of diseases and customising treatment paths. Conclusions The literature reveals several AI applications for health services and a stream of research that has not fully been covered. For instance, AI projects require skills and data quality awareness for data-intensive analysis and knowledge-based management. Insights can help researchers and health professionals understand and address future research on AI in the healthcare field.",

Dynamic Resource Sharing (DRS), which improves the resource utilization compared to the static and fixed resource allocation, thus needs to be further exploited. Blockchain and AI are two promising techniques for DRS in 6G and beyond. In this article, a blockchain and AI-empow-ered DRS architecture is proposed, where block-chain is used to achieve the functionalities in DRS with improved distribution, security and automation, and AI is implemented to improve the performance of pattern recognition and decision-making in DRS. Finally, a case study where dynamic spectrum sharing is implemented within the proposed architecture, and deep reinforcement learning is used and shown to optimize the profit ratio of the users.",

            "paperAbstract": "Background Polypharmacy is common among older adults and it represents a public health concern, due to the negative health impacts potentially associated with the use of several medications. However, the large number of medication combinations and sequences of use makes it complicated for traditional statistical methods to predict which therapy is genuinely associated with health outcomes. The project aims to use artificial intelligence (AI) to determine the quality of polypharmacy among older adults with chronic diseases in the province of Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. Methods We will use data from the Quebec Integrated Chronic Disease Surveillance System (QICDSS). QICDSS contains information about prescribed medications in older adults in Quebec collected over 20\u00a0years. It also includes diagnostic codes and procedures, and sociodemographic data linked through a unique identification number for each individual. Our research will be structured around three interconnected research axes: AI, Health, and Law&Ethics. The AI research axis will develop algorithms for finding frequent patterns of medication use that correlate with health events, considering data locality and temporality (explainable AI or XAI). The Health research axis will translate these patterns into polypharmacy indicators relevant to public health surveillance and clinicians. The Law&Ethics axis will assess the social acceptability of the algorithms developed using AI tools and the indicators developed by the Heath axis and will ensure that the developed indicators neither discriminate against any population group nor increase the disparities already present in the use of medications. Discussion The multi-disciplinary research team consists of specialists in AI, health data, statistics, pharmacy, public health, law, and ethics, which will allow investigation of polypharmacy from different points of view and will contribute to a deeper understanding of the clinical, social, and ethical issues surrounding polypharmacy and its surveillance, as well as the use of AI for health record data. The project results will be disseminated to the scientific community, healthcare professionals, and public health decision-makers in peer-reviewed publications, scientific meetings, and reports. The diffusion of the results will ensure the confidentiality of individual data.",

            "paperAbstract": "Background This study developed a diagnostic tool to automatically detect normal, unclear and tumor images from colonoscopy videos using artificial intelligence. Methods For the creation of training and validation sets, 47,555 images in the jpg format were extracted from colonoscopy videos for 24 patients in Korea University Anam Hospital. A gastroenterologist with the clinical experience of 15\u00a0years divided the 47,555 images into three classes of Normal (25,895), Unclear (2038) and Tumor (19,622). A single shot detector, a deep learning framework designed for object detection, was trained using the 47,255 images and validated with two sets of 300 images\u2014each validation set included 150 images (50 normal, 50 unclear and 50 tumor cases). Half of the 47,255 images were used for building the model and the other half were used for testing the model. The learning rate of the model was 0.0001 during 250 epochs (training cycles). Results The average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score over the category were 0.9067, 0.9744, 0.9067 and 0.9393, respectively. These performance measures had no change with respect to the intersection-over-union threshold (0.45, 0.50, and 0.55). This finding suggests the stability of the model. Conclusion Automated detection of normal, unclear and tumor images from colonoscopy videos is possible by using a deep learning framework. This is expected to provide an invaluable decision supporting system for clinical experts.",

            "paperAbstract": "Background It is encouraging to see a substantial increase in individuals surviving cancer. Even more so since most of them will have a positive effect on society by returning to work. However, many cancer survivors have unmet needs, especially when it comes to improving their quality of life (QoL). Only few survivors are able to meet all of the recommendations regarding well-being and there is a body of evidence that cancer survivors\u2019 needs often remain neglected from health policy and national cancer control plans. This increases the impact of inequalities in cancer care and adds a dangerous component to it. The inequalities affect the individual survivor, their career, along with their relatives and society as a whole. The current study will evaluate the impact of the use of big data analytics and artificial intelligence on the self-efficacy of participants following intervention supported by digital tools. The secondary endpoints include evaluation of the impact of patient trajectories (from retrospective data) and patient gathered health data on prediction and improved intervention against possible secondary disease or negative outcomes (e.g. late toxicities, fatal events). Methods/design The study is designed as a single-case experimental prospective study where each individual serves as its own control group with basal measurements obtained at the recruitment and subsequent measurements performed every 6\u00a0months during follow ups. The measurement will involve CASE-cancer, Patient Activation Measure and System Usability Scale. The study will involve 160 survivors (80 survivors of Breast Cancer and 80 survivors of Colorectal Cancer) from four countries, Belgium, Latvia, Slovenia, and Spain. The intervention will be implemented via a digital tool (mHealthApplication), collecting objective biomarkers (vital signs) and subjective biomarkers (PROs) with the support of a (embodied) conversational agent. Additionally, the Clinical Decision Support system (CDSS), including visualization of cohorts and trajectories will enable oncologists to personalize treatment for an efficient care plan and follow-up management. Discussion We expect that cancer survivors will significantly increase their self-efficacy following the personalized intervention supported by the m-HealthApplication compared to control measurements at recruitment. We expect to observe improvement in healthy habits, disease self-management and self-perceived QoL. Trial registration ISRCTN97617326. https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN97617326 .

            "paperAbstract": "Purpose To compare breast cancer detection performance of radiologists reading mammographic examinations unaided versus supported by an artificial intelligence (AI) system. Materials and Methods An enriched retrospective, fully crossed, multireader, multicase, HIPAA-compliant study was performed. Screening digital mammographic examinations from 240 women (median age, 62 years; range, 39-89 years) performed between 2013 and 2017 were included. The 240 examinations (100 showing cancers, 40 leading to false-positive recalls, 100 normal) were interpreted by 14 Mammography Quality Standards Act-qualified radiologists, once with and once without AI support. The readers provided a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System score and probability of malignancy. AI support provided radiologists with interactive decision support (clicking on a breast region yields a local cancer likelihood score), traditional lesion markers for computer-detected abnormalities, and an examination-based cancer likelihood score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), specificity and sensitivity, and reading time were compared between conditions by using mixed-models analysis dof variance and generalized linear models for multiple repeated measurements. Results On average, the AUC was higher with AI support than with unaided reading (0.89 vs 0.87, respectively; P = .002). Sensitivity increased with AI support (86% [86 of 100] vs 83% [83 of 100]; P = .046), whereas specificity trended toward improvement (79% [111 of 140]) vs 77% [108 of 140]; P = .06). Reading time per case was similar (unaided, 146 seconds; supported by AI, 149 seconds; P = .15). The AUC with the AI system alone was similar to the average AUC of the radiologists (0.89 vs 0.87). Conclusion Radiologists improved their cancer detection at mammography when using an artificial intelligence system for support, without requiring additional reading time.

            "paperAbstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) \u2014 the ability of a machine to perform cognitive tasks to\u00a0achieve a particular goal based on provided data \u2014 is revolutionizing and reshaping our health-care systems. The current availability of ever-increasing computational power, highly developed pattern recognition algorithms and advanced image processing software working at\u00a0very high speeds has led to the emergence of computer-based systems that are trained to perform complex tasks in bioinformatics, medical imaging and medical robotics. Accessibility to\u00a0\u2018big data\u2019 enables the \u2018cognitive\u2019 computer to scan billions of bits of unstructured information, extract the relevant information and recognize complex patterns with increasing confidence. Computer-based decision-support systems based on machine learning (ML) have the potential to revolutionize medicine by performing complex tasks that are currently assigned to specialists to improve diagnostic accuracy, increase efficiency of throughputs, improve clinical workflow, decrease human resource costs and improve treatment choices. These characteristics could be especially helpful in the management of prostate cancer, with growing applications in diagnostic imaging, surgical interventions, skills training and assessment, digital pathology and genomics. Medicine must adapt to this changing world, and urologists, oncologists, radiologists and pathologists, as high-volume users of imaging and pathology, need to understand this burgeoning science and acknowledge that the development of highly accurate AI-based decision-support applications\u00a0of\u00a0ML will require collaboration between data scientists, computer researchers and engineers.Machine learning (ML) is revolutionizing and reshaping health care, and computer-based systems can be trained to perform complex tasks in bioinformatics, medical imaging and medical robotics. In this Review, Goldenberg et al. consider ML in the management of prostate cancer, with growing applications in diagnostic imaging, surgical interventions, skills training and assessment, digital pathology and genomics.Key pointsApplications of machine learning (ML) to prostate cancer care are rapidly growing owing to the many technological platforms involved in its diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.In diagnostic imaging, ML is applied to perform low-level image analysis tasks such as prostate segmentation and fusion of different modalities (for example MRI, CT and ultrasonography) and high-level inference and prediction tasks such as prostate cancer detection and characterization.ML algorithms are able to enhance prostate cancer treatment by augmenting the surgeon\u2019s display with information such as cancer localization during robotic procedures and other image-guided interventions and could be used towards autonomous manipulation of tools for assistance in the operating room.Computer-assisted diagnosis of prostate cancer in histopathological slides could be achieved by ML in order to optimize accuracy, reproducibility and throughput and to further enhance health-care delivery by enabling the use of customized precision-care pathways.ML methods are used to identify genes or groups of genes for which expression specificity to predict outcomes of prostate cancer is high and could be used for screening, developing diagnostic tools, determining optimal individualized treatment and producing targeted drug regimens.Collaboration between urologists, data scientists, computer researchers and engineers is required to ensure that artificial intelligence (AI)-based decision-support applications are properly trained, operated and regulated.",

            "paperAbstract": "Summary In recent years, there has been massive progress in artificial intelligence (AI) with the development of deep neural networks, natural language processing, computer vision and robotics. These techniques are now actively being applied in healthcare with many of the health service activities currently being delivered by clinicians and administrators predicted to be taken over by AI in the coming years. However, there has also been exceptional hype about the abilities of AI with a mistaken notion that AI will replace human clinicians altogether. These perspectives are inaccurate, and if a balanced perspective of the limitations and promise of AI is taken, one can gauge which parts of the health system AI can be integrated to make a meaningful impact. The four main areas where AI would have the most influence would be: patient administration, clinical decision support, patient monitoring and healthcare interventions. This health system where AI plays a central role could be termed an AI-enabled or AI-augmented health system. In this article, we discuss how this system can be developed based on a realistic assessment of current AI technologies and predicted developments.",

The AMA would implement a quasi-relativistic version of the \u201cideal observer\u201d famously described by Roderick Firth. We describe similarities and differences between the AMA and Firth\u2019s ideal observer. Like Firth\u2019s ideal observer, the AMA is disinterested, dispassionate, and consistent in its judgments. Unlike Firth\u2019s observer, the AMA is non-absolutist, because it would take into account the human agent\u2019s own principles and values. We argue that the AMA would respect and indeed enhance individuals\u2019 moral autonomy, help individuals achieve wide and a narrow reflective equilibrium, make up for the limitations of human moral psychology in a way that takes conservatives\u2019 objections to human bioenhancement seriously, and implement the positive functions of intuitions and emotions in human morality without their downsides, such as biases and prejudices.",

            "paperAbstract": "Compressed air systems are often the most expensive and inefficient industrial systems. For every 10 units of energy, less than 1 unit turns into useful compressed air. Air compressors tend to be kept fully on even if they are not (all) needed. The research proposed in this short paper will combine real time ambient sensing with Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Management to automatically improve efficiency in energy intensive manufacturing. The research will minimise energy use for air compressors based on real-time manufacturing conditions (and anticipated future requirements). Ambient data will provide detailed information on performance. Artificial Intelligence will make sense of that data and automatically act. Knowledge Management will facilitate the processing of information to advise human operators on actions to reduce energy use and maintain productivity. The aim is to create new intelligent techniques to save energy in compressed air systems.",

            "paperAbstract": "A socially intelligent robot must be capable to extract meaningful information in real time from the social environment and react accordingly with coherent human-like behavior. Moreover, it should be able to internalize this information, to reason on it at a higher level, build its own opinions independently, and then automatically bias the decision-making according to its unique experience. In the last decades, neuroscience research highlighted the link between the evolution of such complex behavior and the evolution of a certain level of consciousness, which cannot leave out of a body that feels emotions as discriminants and prompters. In order to develop cognitive systems for social robotics with greater human-likeliness, we used an \u201cunderstanding by building\u201d approach to model and implement a well-known theory of mind in the form of an artificial intelligence, and we tested it on a sophisticated robotic platform. The name of the presented system is SEAI (Social Emotional Artificial Intelligence), a cognitive system specifically conceived for social and emotional robots. It is designed as a bio-inspired, highly modular, hybrid system with emotion modeling and high-level reasoning capabilities. It follows the deliberative/reactive paradigm where a knowledge-based expert system is aimed at dealing with the high-level symbolic reasoning, while a more conventional reactive paradigm is deputed to the low-level processing and control. The SEAI system is also enriched by a model that simulates the Damasio\u2019s theory of consciousness and the theory of Somatic Markers. After a review of similar bio-inspired cognitive systems, we present the scientific foundations and their computational formalization at the basis of the SEAI framework. Then, a deeper technical description of the architecture is disclosed underlining the numerous parallelisms with the human cognitive system. Finally, the influence of artificial emotions and feelings, and their link with the robot\u2019s beliefs and decisions have been tested in a physical humanoid involved in Human\u2013Robot Interaction (HRI).",

            "paperAbstract": "Since early 2020, the whole world has been facing the deadly and highly contagious disease named coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the World Health Organization declared the pandemic on 11 March 2020. Over 23 million positive cases of COVID-19 have been reported till late August 2020. Medical images such as chest X-rays and Computed Tomography scans are becoming one of the main leading clinical diagnosis tools in fighting against COVID-19, underpinned by Artificial Intelligence based techniques, resulting in rapid decision-making in saving lives. This article provides an extensive review of AI-based methods to assist medical practitioners with comprehensive knowledge of the efficient AI-based methods for efficient COVID-19 diagnosis. Nearly all the reported methods so far along with their pros and cons as well as recommendations for improvements are discussed, including image acquisition, segmentation, classification, and follow-up diagnosis phases developed between 2019 and 2020. AI and machine learning technologies have boosted the accuracy of Covid-19 diagnosis, and most of the widely used deep learning methods have been implemented and worked well with a small amount of data for COVID-19 diagnosis. This review presents a detailed mythological analysis for the evaluation of AI-based methods used in the process of detecting COVID-19 from medical images. However, due to the quick outbreak of Covid-19, there are not many ground-truth datasets available for the communities. It is necessary to combine clinical experts\u2019 observations and information from images to have a reliable and efficient COVID-19 diagnosis. This paper suggests that future research may focus on multi-modality based models as well as how to select the best model architecture where AI can introduce more intelligence to medical systems to capture the characteristics of diseases by learning from multi-modality data to obtain reliable results for COVID-19 diagnosis for timely treatment .",

Recent medical research has demonstrated the value of using online systems to predict emerging spatial distributions of transmittable diseases. Concerned internet users often resort to online sources in an effort to explain their medical symptoms. This raises the prospect that incidence of COVID-19 may be tracked online by search queries and social media posts analyzed by advanced methods in data science, such as Artificial Intelligence. Online queries can provide early warning of an impending epidemic, which is valuable information needed to support planning timely interventions. Identification of the location of clusters geographically helps to support containment measures by providing information for decision-making and modeling.",

            "paperAbstract": "Introduction: Prognostic scores are important tools in oncology to facilitate clinical decision-making based on patient characteristics. To date, classic survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression has been employed in the development of these prognostic scores. With the advance of analytical models, this study aimed to determine if more complex machine-learning algorithms could outperform classical survival analysis methods. Methods: In this benchmarking study, two datasets were used to develop and compare different prognostic models for overall survival in pan-cancer populations: a nationwide EHR-derived de-identified database for training and in-sample testing and the OAK (phase III clinical trial) dataset for out-of-sample testing. A real-world database comprised 136K first-line treated cancer patients across multiple cancer types and was split into a 90% training and 10% testing dataset, respectively. The OAK dataset comprised 1,187 patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer. To assess the effect of the covariate number on prognostic performance, we formed three feature sets with 27, 44 and 88 covariates. In terms of methods, we benchmarked ROPRO, a prognostic score based on the Cox model, against eight complex machine-learning models: regularized Cox, Random Survival Forests (RSF), Gradient Boosting (GB), DeepSurv (DS), Autoencoder (AE) and Super Learner (SL). The C-index was used as the performance metric to compare different models. Results: For in-sample testing on the real-world database the resulting C-index [95% CI] values for RSF 0.720 [0.716, 0.725], GB 0.722 [0.718, 0.727], DS 0.721 [0.717, 0.726] and lastly, SL 0.723 [0.718, 0.728] showed significantly better performance as compared to ROPRO 0.701 [0.696, 0.706]. Similar results were derived across all feature sets. However, for the out-of-sample validation on OAK, the stronger performance of the more complex models was not apparent anymore. Consistently, the increase in the number of prognostic covariates did not lead to an increase in model performance. Discussion: The stronger performance of the more complex models did not generalize when applied to an out-of-sample dataset. We hypothesize that future research may benefit by adding multimodal data to exploit advantages of more complex models.",

            "paperAbstract": "Recently, artificial intelligence and machine learning in general have demonstrated remarkable performances in many tasks, from image processing to natural language processing, especially with the advent of deep learning (DL). Along with research progress, they have encroached upon many different fields and disciplines. Some of them require high level of accountability and thus transparency, for example, the medical sector. Explanations for machine decisions and predictions are thus needed to justify their reliability. This requires greater interpretability, which often means we need to understand the mechanism underlying the algorithms. Unfortunately, the blackbox nature of the DL is still unresolved, and many machine decisions are still poorly understood. We provide a review on interpretabilities suggested by different research works and categorize them. The different categories show different dimensions in interpretability research, from approaches that provide ``obviously'' interpretable information to the studies of complex patterns. By applying the same categorization to interpretability in medical research, it is hoped that: 1) clinicians and practitioners can subsequently approach these methods with caution; 2) insight into interpretability will be born with more considerations for medical practices; and 3) initiatives to push forward data-based, mathematically grounded, and technically grounded medical education are encouraged.",

            "paperAbstract": "Summary In recent years, there has been massive progress in artificial intelligence (AI) with the development of deep neural networks, natural language processing, computer vision and robotics. These techniques are now actively being applied in healthcare with many of the health service activities currently being delivered by clinicians and administrators predicted to be taken over by AI in the coming years. However, there has also been exceptional hype about the abilities of AI with a mistaken notion that AI will replace human clinicians altogether. These perspectives are inaccurate, and if a balanced perspective of the limitations and promise of AI is taken, one can gauge which parts of the health system AI can be integrated to make a meaningful impact. The four main areas where AI would have the most influence would be: patient administration, clinical decision support, patient monitoring and healthcare interventions. This health system where AI plays a central role could be termed an AI-enabled or AI-augmented health system. In this article, we discuss how this system can be developed based on a realistic assessment of current AI technologies and predicted developments.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract An estimated 425 million people globally have diabetes, accounting for 12% of the world's health expenditures, and yet 1 in 2 persons remain undiagnosed and untreated. Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive computing offer promise in diabetes care. The purpose of this article is to better understand what AI advances may be relevant today to persons with diabetes (PWDs), their clinicians, family, and caregivers. The authors conducted a predefined, online PubMed search of publicly available sources of information from 2009 onward using the search terms \u201cdiabetes\u201d and \u201cartificial intelligence.\u201d The study included clinically-relevant, high-impact articles, and excluded articles whose purpose was technical in nature. A total of 450 published diabetes and AI articles met the inclusion criteria. The studies represent a diverse and complex set of innovative approaches that aim to transform diabetes care in 4 main areas: automated retinal screening, clinical decision support, predictive population risk stratification, and patient self-management tools. Many of these new AI-powered retinal imaging systems, predictive modeling programs, glucose sensors, insulin pumps, smartphone applications, and other decision-support aids are on the market today with more on the way. AI applications have the potential to transform diabetes care and help millions of PWDs to achieve better blood glucose control, reduce hypoglycemic episodes, and reduce diabetes comorbidities and complications. AI applications offer greater accuracy, efficiency, ease of use, and satisfaction for PWDs, their clinicians, family, and caregivers.",

            "paperAbstract": "Radiomics is a relatively new word for the field of radiology, meaning the extraction of a high number of quantitative features from medical images. Artificial intelligence (AI) is broadly a set of advanced computational algorithms that basically learn the patterns in the data provided to make predictions on unseen data sets. Radiomics can be coupled with AI because of its better capability of handling a massive amount of data compared with the traditional statistical methods. Together, the primary purpose of these fields is to extract and analyze as much and meaningful hidden quantitative data as possible to be used in decision support. Nowadays, both radiomics and AI have been getting attention for their remarkable success in various radiological tasks, which has been met with anxiety by most of the radiologists due to the fear of replacement by intelligent machines. Considering ever-developing advances in computational power and availability of large data sets, the marriage of humans and machines in future clinical practice seems inevitable. Therefore, regardless of their feelings, the radiologists should be familiar with these concepts. Our goal in this paper was three-fold: first, to familiarize radiologists with the radiomics and AI; second, to encourage the radiologists to get involved in these ever-developing fields; and, third, to provide a set of recommendations for good practice in design and assessment of future works.",

            "title": "Artificial Intelligence Versus Clinicians in Disease Diagnosis: Systematic Review",
            "paperAbstract": "Background Artificial intelligence (AI) has been extensively used in a range of medical fields to promote therapeutic development. The development of diverse AI techniques has also contributed to early detections, disease diagnoses, and referral management. However, concerns about the value of advanced AI in disease diagnosis have been raised by health care professionals, medical service providers, and health policy decision makers. Objective This review aimed to systematically examine the literature, in particular, focusing on the performance comparison between advanced AI and human clinicians to provide an up-to-date summary regarding the extent of the application of AI to disease diagnoses. By doing so, this review discussed the relationship between the current advanced AI development and clinicians with respect to disease diagnosis and thus therapeutic development in the long run. Methods We systematically searched articles published between January 2000 and March 2019 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis in the following databases: Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. According to the preset inclusion and exclusion criteria, only articles comparing the medical performance between advanced AI and human experts were considered. Results A total of 9 articles were identified. A convolutional neural network was the commonly applied advanced AI technology. Owing to the variation in medical fields, there is a distinction between individual studies in terms of classification, labeling, training process, dataset size, and algorithm validation of AI. Performance indices reported in articles included diagnostic accuracy, weighted errors, false-positive rate, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results showed that the performance of AI was at par with that of clinicians and exceeded that of clinicians with less experience. Conclusions Current AI development has a diagnostic performance that is comparable with medical experts, especially in image recognition-related fields. Further studies can be extended to other types of medical imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and other medical practices unrelated to images. With the continued development of AI-assisted technologies, the clinical implications underpinned by clinicians\u2019 experience and guided by patient-centered health care principle should be constantly considered in future AI-related and other technology-based medical research.",

These novel tools are already having a major impact in radiology, diagnostics, and many other fields in which the availability of automated solution may benefit the accuracy and repeatability of the execution of critical tasks. In this narrative review, we first present a brief description of the various techniques that are being developed nowadays, with special focus on those used in spine research. Then, we describe the applications of AI and ML to problems related to the spine which have been published so far, including the localization of vertebrae and discs in radiological images, image segmentation, computer\u2010aided diagnosis, prediction of clinical outcomes and complications, decision support systems, content\u2010based image retrieval, biomechanics, and motion analysis. Finally, we briefly discuss major ethical issues related to the use of AI in healthcare, namely, accountability, risk of biased decisions as well as data privacy and security, which are nowadays being debated in the scientific community and by regulatory agencies.",

            "paperAbstract": "Background Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care have garnered much attention in recent years, but the implementation issues posed by AI have not been substantially addressed. Objective In this paper, we have focused on machine learning (ML) as a form of AI and have provided a framework for thinking about use cases of ML in health care. We have structured our discussion of challenges in the implementation of ML in comparison with other technologies using the framework of Nonadoption, Abandonment, and Challenges to the Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability of Health and Care Technologies (NASSS). Methods After providing an overview of AI technology, we describe use cases of ML as falling into the categories of decision support and automation. We suggest these use cases apply to clinical, operational, and epidemiological tasks and that the primary function of ML in health care in the near term will be decision support. We then outline unique implementation issues posed by ML initiatives in the categories addressed by the NASSS framework, specifically including meaningful decision support, explainability, privacy, consent, algorithmic bias, security, scalability, the role of corporations, and the changing nature of health care work. Results Ultimately, we suggest that the future of ML in health care remains positive but uncertain, as support from patients, the public, and a wide range of health care stakeholders is necessary to enable its meaningful implementation. Conclusions If the implementation science community is to facilitate the adoption of ML in ways that stand to generate widespread benefits, the issues raised in this paper will require substantial attention in the coming years.",

A better understanding of the techniques of AI employed and of the sports that are using AI is clearly warranted. The purpose of this study is to identify which AI approaches have been applied to investigate sport performance and injury risk and to find out which AI techniques each sport has been using.MethodsSystematic searches through the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science online databases were conducted for articles reporting AI techniques or methods applied to team sports athletes.ResultsFifty-eight studies were included in the review with 11 AI techniques or methods being applied in 12 team sports. Pooled sample consisted of 6456 participants (97% male, 25\u2009\u00b1\u20098\u2009years old; 3% female, 21\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u2009years old) with 76% of them being professional athletes. The AI techniques or methods most frequently used were artificial neural networks, decision tree classifier, support vector machine, and Markov process with good performance metrics for all of them. Soccer, basketball, handball, and volleyball were the team sports with more applications of AI.ConclusionsThe results of this review suggest a prevalent application of AI methods in team sports based on the number of published studies. The current state of development in the area proposes a promising future with regard to AI use in\u00a0team sports. Further evaluation research based on prospective methods is warranted to establish the predictive performance of specific AI techniques and methods.",

            "paperAbstract": "Breast cancer care is a leading area for development of artificial intelligence (AI), with applications including screening and diagnosis, risk calculation, prognostication and clinical decision-support, management planning, and precision medicine. We review the ethical, legal and social implications of these developments. We consider the values encoded in algorithms, the need to evaluate outcomes, and issues of bias and transferability, data ownership, confidentiality and consent, and legal, moral and professional responsibility. We consider potential effects for patients, including on trust in healthcare, and provide some social science explanations for the apparent rush to implement AI solutions. We conclude by anticipating future directions for AI in breast cancer care. Stakeholders in healthcare AI should acknowledge that their enterprise is an ethical, legal and social challenge, not just a technical challenge. Taking these challenges seriously will require broad engagement, imposition of conditions on implementation, and pre-emptive systems of oversight to ensure that development does not run ahead of evaluation and deliberation. Once artificial intelligence becomes institutionalised, it may be difficult to reverse: a proactive role for government, regulators and professional groups will help ensure introduction in robust research contexts, and the development of a sound evidence base regarding real-world effectiveness. Detailed public discussion is required to consider what kind of AI is acceptable rather than simply accepting what is offered, thus optimising outcomes for health systems, professionals, society and those receiving care.",

            "paperAbstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad transdisciplinary field with roots in logic, statistics, cognitive psychology, decision theory, neuroscience, linguistics, cybernetics, and computer engineering. The modern field of AI began at a small summer workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. Since then, AI applications made possible by machine learning (ML), an AI subdiscipline, include Internet searches, e-commerce sites, goods and services recommender systems, image and speech recognition, sensor technologies, robotic devices, and cognitive decision support systems (DSSs). As more applications are integrated into everyday life, AI is predicted to have a globally transformative influence on economic and social structures similar to the effect that other general-purpose technologies, such as steam engines, railroads, electricity, electronics, and the Internet, have had. Novel AI applications in the workplace of the future raise important issues for occupational safety and health. This commentary reviews the origins of AI, use of ML methods, and emerging AI applications embedded in physical objects like sensor technologies, robotic devices, or operationalized in intelligent DSSs. Selected implications on the future of work arising from the use of AI applications, including job displacement from automation and management of human-machine interactions, are also reviewed. Engaging in strategic foresight about AI workplace applications will shift occupational research and practice from a reactive posture to a proactive one. Understanding the possibilities and challenges of AI for the future of work will help mitigate\u00a0the unfavorable effects of AI on worker safety, health, and well-being.",

            "paperAbstract": "There has been a recent resurgence in the area of explainable artificial intelligence as researchers and practitioners seek to make their algorithms more understandable. Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a `good' explanation. There exists vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations towards the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence should build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence.",

            "paperAbstract": "BACKGROUND\nSeveral recent publications have demonstrated the use of convolutional neural networks to classify images of melanoma at par with board-certified dermatologists. However, the non-availability of a public human benchmark restricts the comparability of the performance of these algorithms and thereby the technical progress in this field.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAn electronic questionnaire was sent to dermatologists at 12 German university hospitals. Each questionnaire comprised 100 dermoscopic and 100 clinical images (80 nevi images and 20 biopsy-verified melanoma images, each), all open-source. The questionnaire recorded factors such as the years of experience in dermatology, performed skin checks, age, sex\u00a0and the rank within the university hospital or the status as resident physician. For each image, the dermatologists were asked to provide a management decision (treat/biopsy lesion or reassure the patient). Main outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity and the receiver operating characteristics (ROC).\n\n\nRESULTS\nTotal 157 dermatologists assessed all 100 dermoscopic images with an overall sensitivity of 74.1%, specificity of 60.0%\u00a0and an ROC of 0.67 (range\u00a0=\u00a00.538-0.769); 145 dermatologists assessed all 100 clinical images with an overall sensitivity of 89.4%, specificity of 64.4%\u00a0and an ROC of 0.769 (range\u00a0=\u00a00.613-0.9). Results between test-sets were significantly different (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) confirming the need for a standardised benchmark.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe present the first public melanoma classification benchmark for both non-dermoscopic and dermoscopic images for comparing artificial intelligence algorithms with diagnostic performance of 145 or 157 dermatologists. Melanoma Classification Benchmark should be considered as a reference standard for white-skinned Western populations in the field of binary algorithmic melanoma classification.",

            "paperAbstract": "In this paper I argue that the search for explainable models and interpretable decisions in AI must be reformulated in terms of the broader project of offering a pragmatic and naturalistic account of understanding in AI. Intuitively, the purpose of providing an explanation of a model or a decision is to make it understandable to its stakeholders. But without a previous grasp of what it means to say that an agent understands a model or a decision, the explanatory strategies will lack a well-defined goal. Aside from providing a clearer objective for XAI, focusing on understanding also allows us to relax the factivity condition on explanation, which is impossible to fulfill in many machine learning models, and to focus instead on the pragmatic conditions that determine the best fit between a model and the methods and devices deployed to understand it. After an examination of the different types of understanding discussed in the philosophical and psychological literature, I conclude that interpretative or approximation models not only provide the best way to achieve the objectual understanding of a machine learning model, but are also a necessary condition to achieve post hoc interpretability. This conclusion is partly based on the shortcomings of the purely functionalist approach to post hoc interpretability that seems to be predominant in most recent literature.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract This paper presents a vision for a Disaster City Digital Twin paradigm that can: (i) enable interdisciplinary convergence in the field of crisis informatics and information and communication technology (ICT) in disaster management; (ii) integrate artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and approaches to improve situation assessment, decision making, and coordination among various stakeholders; and (iii) enable increased visibility into network dynamics of complex disaster management and humanitarian actions. The number of humanitarian relief actions is growing due to the increased frequency of natural and man-made crises. Various streams of research across different disciplines have focused on ICT and AI solutions for enhancing disaster management processes. However, most of the existing research is fragmented without a common vision towards a converging paradigm. Recognizing this, this paper presents the Disaster City Digital Twin as a unifying paradigm. The four main components of the proposed Digital Twin paradigm include: multi-data sensing for data collection, data integration and analytics, multi-actor game-theoretic decision making, and dynamic network analysis. For each component, the current state of the art related to AI methods and approaches are examined and gaps are identified.",

Direct-to-consumer wellness products and mobile apps, pervasive sensor technologies and access to social network data offer exciting opportunities for researchers to passively observe and/or track patients \u2018in the wild\u2019 and 24/7. The volume of granular personal health data gathered using these technologies is unprecedented, and is increasingly leveraged to inform personalized health promotion and disease treatment interventions. The use of artificial intelligence in the health sector is also increasing. Although rich with potential, the digital health ecosystem presents new ethical challenges for those making decisions about the selection, testing, implementation and evaluation of technologies for use in healthcare. As the \u2018Wild West\u2019 of digital health research unfolds, it is important to recognize who is involved, and identify how each party can and should take responsibility to advance the ethical practices of this work. While not a comprehensive review, we describe the landscape, identify gaps to be addressed, and offer recommendations as to how stakeholders can and should take responsibility to advance socially responsible digital health research.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract The use of asynchronous video interviews (AVIs) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based decision agents enables more efficient employment screening compared with traditional synchronous video interviews (SVIs). However, the social impacts of using synchrony and AI decision agents in video interviews have not been investigated. Drawing on media richness theory and social interface theory, this study employed a novel experimental design to compare human ratings and job applicants' response behaviours between the SVI and AVI settings and compare job applicants\u2019 fairness perception between the AVI setting and the AVI setting using an AI decision agent (AVI-AI). The results from 180 observations revealed that 1) first impression and physical appearance significantly affected structured interview ratings regardless of whether the video interview was synchronous; 2) compared with SVIs, AVIs lessened the primacy effect on physical appearance and initial impression among human raters; 3) job applicants had indistinguishable fairness perceptions regarding synchrony (SVI vs. AVI) and decision agent (human vs. AI); and 4) applicants exhibited less favourability towards AVIs than towards SVIs. Findings from this experimental comparison, including recommendations for practice and future research on human resource selection, technology education, and social computing, are discussed.",

            "paperAbstract": "Over the next decade, one issue which will dominate sociotechnical studies in health informatics is the extent to which the promise of artificial intelligence in health care will be realized, along with the social and ethical issues which accompany it. A useful thought experiment is the application of the Turing test to user-facing artificial intelligence systems in health care (such as chatbots or conversational agents). In this paper I argue that many medical decisions require value judgements and the doctor-patient relationship requires empathy and understanding to arrive at a shared decision, often handling large areas of uncertainty and balancing competing risks. Arguably, medicine requires wisdom more than intelligence, artificial or otherwise. Artificial intelligence therefore needs to supplement rather than replace medical professionals, and identifying the complementary positioning of artificial intelligence in medical consultation is a key challenge for the future. In health care, artificial intelligence needs to pass the implementation game, not the imitation game.",

            "paperAbstract": "Imagine an algorithm that selects nursing candidates for a multi-specialty practice\u2014but it only selects white females. Consider a revolutionary test for skin cancer that does not work on African Americans. What about a model that directs poorer patients to a skilled nursing facility rather than their home as it does for wealthier patients? These are ways in which ungoverned artificial intelligence (AI) might perpetuate bias. With the current hyperbole around AI approaching an all-time high, it takes little imagination to see how the algorithms applied in other industries can be used in health care. Google algorithms for automated image classification can be modified to read CT scans of a patient with cancer [1] or predict treatable blinding retinal diseases [2]. The AI methods used to predict the risk of loan default can be tweaked to predict the risk of sepsis [3, 4] or pneumonia [5]. In health care, clinical decision support has long been integrated into our electronic health records to guide safe medication use, use of clinical best practices, and prioritization of high-risk patients. We could, of course, choose to ignore any algorithm's suggestions much like we might snub Amazon's book recommendations. However, when AI systems go beyond recommendations and act autonomously, we must pause and consider the implications. At best, we streamline processes, reduce variation in care, and remove human biases from decision-making [6-8]. At worst, we erode trust, perpetuate gender, ethnicity, and income disparities, and distance ourselves from patient care decisions. There is ample evidence of bias\u2026",

We will show how significant complex investigations, hardly solvable for human experts, can be expressed as optimization problems belonging in many cases to the \u2119$\\mathbb {P}$ or \u2115\u2119$\\mathbb {N}\\mathbb {P}$ complexity classes. All these problems can be expressed in ASP. As a proof of concept, in this paper we present the formalization of realistic investigative cases via simple ASP programs, and show how such a methodology can lead to the formulation of tangible investigative hypotheses. We also sketch a design for a feasible Decision Support System (DSS) especially meant for investigators, based on artificial intelligence tools.",

Examples of this rapid development can be seen in image recognition, speech analysis, strategic game planning and many more. The problem with many state-of-the-art models is a lack of transparency and interpretability. The lack of thereof is a major drawback in many applications, e.g. healthcare and finance, where rationale for model's decision is a requirement for trust. In the light of these issues, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become an area of interest in research community. This paper summarizes recent developments in XAI in supervised learning, starts a discussion on its connection with artificial general intelligence, and gives proposals for further research directions.",

            "paperAbstract": "\n Abstract\n \n This study presents a systematic review of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques used in the detection and classification of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) medical images in terms of evaluation and benchmarking. Five reliable databases, namely, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus were used to obtain relevant studies of the given topic. Several filtering and scanning stages were performed according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria to screen the 36 studies obtained; however, only 11 studies met the criteria. Taxonomy was performed, and the 11 studies were classified on the basis of two categories, namely, review and research studies. Then, a deep analysis and critical review were performed to highlight the challenges and critical gaps outlined in the academic literature of the given subject. Results showed that no relevant study evaluated and benchmarked AI techniques utilised in classification tasks (i.e. binary, multi-class, multi-labelled and hierarchical classifications) of COVID-19 medical images. In case evaluation and benchmarking will be conducted, three future challenges will be encountered, namely, multiple evaluation criteria within each classification task, trade-off amongst criteria and importance of these criteria. According to the discussed future challenges, the process of evaluation and benchmarking AI techniques used in the classification of COVID-19 medical images considered multi-complex attribute problems. Thus, adopting multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is an essential and effective approach to tackle the problem complexity. Moreover, this study proposes a detailed methodology for the evaluation and benchmarking of AI techniques used in all classification tasks of COVID-19 medical images as future directions; such methodology is presented on the basis of three sequential phases. Firstly, the identification procedure for the construction of four decision matrices, namely, binary, multi-class, multi-labelled and hierarchical, is presented on the basis of the intersection of evaluation criteria of each classification task and AI classification techniques. Secondly, the development of the MCDA approach for benchmarking AI classification techniques is provided on the basis of the integrated analytic hierarchy process and VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje methods. Lastly, objective and subjective validation procedures are described to validate the proposed benchmarking solutions.\n \n",

            "paperAbstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI)\u2010based systems are widely employed nowadays to make decisions that have far\u2010reaching impact on individuals and society. Their decisions might affect everyone, everywhere, and anytime, entailing concerns about potential human rights issues. Therefore, it is necessary to move beyond traditional AI algorithms optimized for predictive performance and embed ethical and legal principles in their design, training, and deployment to ensure social good while still benefiting from the huge potential of the AI technology. The goal of this survey is to provide a broad multidisciplinary overview of the area of bias in AI systems, focusing on technical challenges and solutions as well as to suggest new research directions towards approaches well\u2010grounded in a legal frame. In this survey, we focus on data\u2010driven AI, as a large part of AI is powered nowadays by (big) data and powerful machine learning algorithms. If otherwise not specified, we use the general term bias to describe problems related to the gathering or processing of data that might result in prejudiced decisions on the bases of demographic features such as race, sex, and so forth.",

Because therapy recommendations provided by a decision support system can benefit both patients and doctors, we evaluated the impact of an artificial intelligence decision support system, the Anemia Control Model (ACM), on anemia outcomes. Based on patient profiles, the ACM was built to recommend suitable erythropoietic-stimulating agent doses. Our retrospective study consisted of a 12-month control phase (standard anemia care), followed by a 12-month observation phase (ACM-guided care) encompassing 752 patients undergoing hemodialysis therapy in 3 NephroCare clinics located in separate countries. The percentage of hemoglobin values on target, the median darbepoetin dose, and individual hemoglobin fluctuation (estimated from the intrapatient hemoglobin standard deviation) were deemed primary outcomes. In the observation phase, median darbepoetin consumption significantly decreased from 0.63 to 0.46 \u03bcg/kg/month, whereas on-target hemoglobin values significantly increased from 70.6% to 76.6%, reaching 83.2% when the ACM suggestions were implemented. Moreover, ACM introduction led to a significant decrease in hemoglobin fluctuation (intrapatient standard deviation decreased from 0.95 g/dl to 0.83 g/dl). Thus, ACM support helped improve anemia outcomes of hemodialysis patients, minimizing erythropoietic-stimulating agent use with the potential to reduce the cost of treatment.",

            "paperAbstract": "This paper discusses the problem of responsibility attribution raised by the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. It is assumed that only humans can be responsible agents; yet this alone already raises many issues, which are discussed starting from two Aristotelian conditions for responsibility. Next to the well-known problem of many hands, the issue of \u201cmany things\u201d is identified and the temporal dimension is emphasized when it comes to the control condition. Special attention is given to the epistemic condition, which draws attention to the issues of transparency and explainability. In contrast to standard discussions, however, it is then argued that this knowledge problem regarding agents of responsibility is linked to the other side of the responsibility relation: the addressees or \u201cpatients\u201d of responsibility, who may demand reasons for actions and decisions made by using AI.

Artificial intelligence programs seek to simulate intelligent human behavior in computers. With an abundance of patient data, especially with the advent and growing use of imaging modalities such as OCT, AI programs provide us with the unique opportunity to analyze this plethora of information and assist in making clinical decisions in the field of ophthalmology. Groups around the world have developed and evaluated AI programs that gather data from diagnostic modalities, such as OCT, that assist in the diagnosis and management of ophthalmological diseases with a high accuracy. Artificial intelligence programs using OCT have the potential to play a significant role in the diagnosis and management of ophthalmological disease in the near future. Incorporation of AI in medicine, however, is not without its pitfalls. Some limitations of AI in ophthalmology are also discussed in this review. These include the deskilling of physicians due to increase in reliance on automation, inability of AI programs to take a holistic approach to clinical encounters with patients, requirement of pre\u2010existing strong datasets to train AI programs, and the inability of AI programs to incorporate the ambiguity and variability that is intrinsic to the nature of clinical medicine.",

            "paperAbstract": "A fire detection system requires accurate and fast mechanisms to make the right decision in a fire situation. Since most commercial fire detection systems use a simple sensor, their fire recognition accuracy is deficient because of the limitations of the detection capability of the sensor. Existing proposals, which use rule-based algorithms or image-based machine learning can hardly adapt to the changes in the environment because of their static features. Since the legacy fire detection systems and network services do not guarantee data transfer latency, the required need for promptness is unmet. In this paper, we propose a new fire detection system with a multifunctional artificial intelligence framework and a data transfer delay minimization mechanism for the safety of smart cities. The framework includes a set of multiple machine learning algorithms and an adaptive fuzzy algorithm. In addition, Direct-MQTT based on SDN is introduced to solve the traffic concentration problems of the traditional MQTT. We verify the performance of the proposed system in terms of accuracy and delay time and found a fire detection accuracy of over 95%. The end-to-end delay, which comprises the transfer and decision delays, is reduced by an average of 72%.",

            "paperAbstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest towards the application of artificial intelligence approaches in software engineering (SE) processes. In the specific area of SE for self-adaptive systems (SASs) there is a growing research awareness about the synergy between SE and AI. However, just few significant results have been published. This paper briefly studies uncertainty in SASs and surveys techniques that have been developed to engineer SASs in order to tackle uncertainty. In particular, we highlight techniques that use AI concepts. We also report and discuss our own experience using Dynamic Decision Networks (DDNs) to model and support decision-making in SASs while explicitly taking into account uncertainty. We think that Bayesian inference, and specifically DDNs, provide a useful formalism to engineer systems that dynamically adapt themselves at runtime as more information about the environment and the execution context is discovered during execution. We also discuss partial results, challenges and future research avenues.",

This paper meets the requirement of KS X ISO 9706, ISO 9706-1994 and ANSI/NISO Z.39.48-1992 (Permanence of Paper). Artificial intelligence (AI) is defined as any techniques that enable the computer to mimic the human brain to simulate human intelligence process. A branch of AI technology is Machine Learning (ML) which is a study of an algorithm to build a model of sample data to make prediction or decision without being programmed for the task. Deep Learning (DL) is a class of ML method based on an artificial neural network utilizing information processing and distribute communication to extract higher-level feature from raw input data. DL can outperform conventional ML as they adapt, learn, and continue to improve with more data, particularly heterogeneous ones such as healthcare data. There are several DL classes. Computer vision known as convolutional neural network (CNN) applied for data with natural spatial invariance such as an image. CNN can aid flagging and second opinion in pathology, ophthalmology, etc. CNN needs extensive data and labeled dataset for training. Natural Language Processing (NLP) also recurrent neural network (RNN) is effective at processing sequential input such as language, speech, and time-series data therefore particularly suitable for electronic health record (EHR) data. RNN can translate patientcare provider conversation, predict future medical incidents from EHR. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is DL for training to interact with the environment through trial and error, demonstration, or a hybrid of both. RL can be applied to robotic surgery with computer vision models. Generalized Deep Learning can adapt to nuanced data requiring specialized treatment such as genomic data which can be applied to predict pathogenicity and phenotype from genome data.[1] AI is applied in drug discovery and development such as validation of target,[2] designing a new drug, drug repurposing, designing polypharmacological agents, improving R&D efficiency through trial design optimization, selection of patient population and monitoring efficacy and safety of patients in clinical trials (Fig. 1). In drug discovery, if AI is properly trained with optimal data, it can provide insight into a new molecule to target, complex metabolic pathways of a compound, and predict toxicity. For example, the US federal government\u2019s Tox21 program, a collaboration among the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institutes of Health, and the Food and Drug Administration, maintains an extensive data set of molecules and their toxicity against key human proteins.[3] This data set can be fed to AI to digest in search of patterns of association between structure, properties, function, and possible toxic effects. The generative adversarial network is one application to develop novel small-molecule compounds to treat various disorders. Another platform aims to mimic the decision making of a medicinal chemist while also learning from human medicinal chemists\u2019 input.[3] Currently there is no reported success case of AI-driven new drug discovery, but numerous partnership between the pharma and AI companies will have a successful outcome in a few years, and this will change the industry permanently. In clinical development, AI tools such as NLP and computer vision can combine omics data, EHR, and biomarkers to identify and characterize most appropriate subpopulation for a trial. This will reduce population heterogeneity and enrich the population. Prognostic enrichment is used for neurological diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD) where key biomarkers were replaced by a combination of multiple cheaper non-invasive measures applying ML methods. Complex models such as disease progression models are required for predictive enrichment. In AD, clinical trial simulation tools were successfully developed.[4] Reviewer This article was invited by the editor of TCP.

            "paperAbstract": "In the last decade, with availability of large datasets and more computing power, machine learning systems have achieved (super)human performance in a wide variety of tasks. Examples of this rapid development can be seen in image recognition, speech analysis, strategic game planning and many more. The problem with many state-of-the-art models is a lack of transparency and interpretability. The lack of thereof is a major drawback in many applications, e.g. healthcare and finance, where rationale for model's decision is a requirement for trust. In the light of these issues, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become an area of interest in research community. This paper summarizes recent developments in XAI in supervised learning, starts a discussion on its connection with artificial general intelligence, and gives proposals for further research directions.",

Automated algorithms, also termed artificial intelligence that are able to extract meaningful patterns from data collections and build decisions upon identified patterns may be useful assistants in clinical decision-making processes. In this article, artificial intelligence-based studies in clinical cardiology are reviewed. The text also touches on the ethical issues and speculates on the future roles of automated algorithms versus clinicians in cardiology and medicine in general.",

In this work, an attempt has been made for review on AI applications in Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP) and manufacturing. Primarily, uniqueness of present review work addressed by analysis of existing review articles. The review work comprise of three main elements; 1. Feature based design, a primary input for a CAPP system, 2. Expert System (ES) usefulness in Process Planning (PP) and manufacturing and 3. Evolutionary approach applications. The review begins with an overview and the use of AI systems in decision making. Research works exemplified for the past three and half decades (1981\u20132016) are analyzed in terms of feature based modeling, Standards for Exchange of Product Model data approach, ES in PP, scheduling, manufacturing and miscellaneous applications. Role of Evolutionary Techniques (ET) in intelligent system development, execution of PP activities and manufacturing are described. A statistical analysis on existing review articles, number of publications, domain specific articles and percentage contribution of each area are carried out. Finally, research gaps are identified and the possible future research directions are presented.",

            "paperAbstract": "\n Summary\n \n Concurrent advances in information technology infrastructure and mobile computing power in many low and middle-income countries (LMICs) have raised hopes that artificial intelligence (AI) might help to address challenges unique to the field of global health and accelerate achievement of the health-related sustainable development goals. A series of fundamental questions have been raised about AI-driven health interventions, and whether the tools, methods, and protections traditionally used to make ethical and evidence-based decisions about new technologies can be applied to AI. Deployment of AI has already begun for a broad range of health issues common to LMICs, with interventions focused primarily on communicable diseases, including tuberculosis and malaria. Types of AI vary, but most use some form of machine learning or signal processing. Several types of machine learning methods are frequently used together, as is machine learning with other approaches, most often signal processing. AI-driven health interventions fit into four categories relevant to global health researchers: (1) diagnosis, (2) patient morbidity or mortality risk assessment, (3) disease outbreak prediction and surveillance, and (4) health policy and planning. However, much of the AI-driven intervention research in global health does not describe ethical, regulatory, or practical considerations required for widespread use or deployment at scale. Despite the field remaining nascent, AI-driven health interventions could lead to improved health outcomes in LMICs. Although some challenges of developing and deploying these interventions might not be unique to these settings, the global health community will need to work quickly to establish guidelines for development, testing, and use, and develop a user-driven research agenda to facilitate equitable and ethical use.\n \n",

            "paperAbstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic started in Italy in February 2020 with an exponential growth that has exceeded the number of cases reported in China. Italian radiology departments found themselves at the forefront in the management of suspected and positive COVID cases, both in diagnosis, in estimating the severity of the disease and in follow-up. In this context SIRM recommends chest X-ray as first-line imaging tool, CT as additional tool that shows typical features of COVID pneumonia, and ultrasound of the lungs as monitoring tool. SIRM recommends, as high priority, to ensure appropriate\u00a0sanitation procedures on the scan equipment after detecting any suspected or positive COVID-19 patients. In this emergency situation, several expectations have been raised by the scientific community about the role that artificial intelligence can have in improving the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus infection, and SIRM wishes to deliver clear statements to the radiological community, on the usefulness of artificial intelligence as a radiological decision support system in COVID-19 positive patients. (1) SIRM supports the research on the use of artificial intelligence as a predictive and prognostic decision support system, especially in hospitalized patients and those admitted to intensive care, and welcomes single center of multicenter studies for a clinical validation of the test. (2) SIRM does not support the use of CT with artificial intelligence for screening or as first-line test to diagnose COVID-19. (3) Chest CT with artificial intelligence cannot replace molecular diagnosis tests with nose-pharyngeal swab (rRT-PCR) in suspected for COVID-19 patients.",

However, the black-box nature of deep neural networks challenges its use in mission critical applications, raising ethical and judicial concerns inducing lack of trust. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that promotes a set of tools, techniques, and algorithms that can generate high-quality interpretable, intuitive, human-understandable explanations of AI decisions. In addition to providing a holistic view of the current XAI landscape in deep learning, this paper provides mathematical summaries of seminal work. We start by proposing a taxonomy and categorizing the XAI techniques based on their scope of explanations, methodology behind the algorithms, and explanation level or usage which helps build trustworthy, interpretable, and self-explanatory deep learning models. We then describe the main principles used in XAI research and present the historical timeline for landmark studies in XAI from 2007 to 2020. After explaining each category of algorithms and approaches in detail, we then evaluate the explanation maps generated by eight XAI algorithms on image data, discuss the limitations of this approach, and provide potential future directions to improve XAI evaluation.",

            "paperAbstract": "Data-driven computational approaches have evolved to enable extraction of information from medical images with reliability, accuracy, and speed, which is already transforming their interpretation and exploitation in clinical practice. While similar benefits are longed for in the field of interventional imaging, this ambition is challenged by a much higher heterogeneity. Clinical workflows within interventional suites and operating theaters are extremely complex and typically rely on poorly integrated intraoperative devices, sensors, and support infrastructures. Taking stock of some of the most exciting developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence for computer-assisted interventions, we highlight the crucial need to take the context and human factors into account in order to address these challenges. Contextual artificial intelligence for computer-assisted intervention (CAI4CAI) arises as an emerging opportunity feeding into the broader field of surgical data science. Central challenges being addressed in CAI4CAI include how to integrate the ensemble of prior knowledge and instantaneous sensory information from experts, sensors, and actuators; how to create and communicate a faithful and actionable shared representation of the surgery among a mixed human\u2013AI actor team; and how to design interventional systems and associated cognitive shared control schemes for online uncertainty-aware collaborative decision-making ultimately producing more precise and reliable interventions.",

            "paperAbstract": "Increasingly, interventions aimed at improving care are likely to use such technologies as machine learning and artificial intelligence. However, health care has been relatively late to adopt them. This article provides clinical examples in which machine learning and artificial intelligence are already in use in health care and appear to deliver benefit. Three key bottlenecks toward increasing the pace of diffusion and adoption are methodological issues in evaluation of artificial intelligence-based interventions, reporting standards to enable assessment of model performance, and issues that need to be addressed for an institution to adopt these interventions. Methodological best practices will include external validation, ideally at a different site; use of proactive learning algorithms to correct for site-specific biases and increase robustness as algorithms are deployed across multiple sites; addressing subgroup performance; and communicating to providers the uncertainty of predictions. Regarding reporting, especially important issues are the extent to which implementing standardized approaches for introducing clinical decision support has been followed, describing the data sources, reporting on data assumptions, and addressing biases. Although most health care organizations in the United States have adopted electronic health records, they may be ill prepared to adopt machine learning and artificial intelligence. Several steps can enable this: preparing data, developing tools to get suggestions to clinicians in useful ways, and getting clinicians engaged in the process. Open challenges and the role of regulation in this area are briefly discussed. Although these techniques have enormous potential to improve care and personalize recommendations for individuals, the hype regarding them is tremendous. Organizations will need to approach this domain carefully with knowledgeable partners to obtain the hoped-for benefits and avoid failures.",

            "paperAbstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest towards the application of artificial intelligence approaches in software engineering (SE) processes. In the specific area of SE for self-adaptive systems (SASs) there is a growing research awareness about the synergy between SE and AI. However, just few significant results have been published. This paper briefly studies uncertainty in SASs and surveys techniques that have been developed to engineer SASs in order to tackle uncertainty. In particular, we highlight techniques that use AI concepts. We also report and discuss our own experience using Dynamic Decision Networks (DDNs) to model and support decision-making in SASs while explicitly taking into account uncertainty. We think that Bayesian inference, and specifically DDNs, provide a useful formalism to engineer systems that dynamically adapt themselves at runtime as more information about the environment and the execution context is discovered during execution. We also discuss partial results, challenges and future research avenues.",

            "paperAbstract": "We read with interest the recent article by Lin et al. [1] aimed to compare the diagnostic efficacy between CC-Cruiser a developed artificial intelligence (AI) platform [2] and ophthalmologists in real-world clinical settings in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). They concluded that CC-Cruiser had the capacity to assist doctors in clinical practice even though it showed less accuracy compared to senior consultants in diagnosing and making treatment decisions. However, we believe that the study design of the research could be improved by deeply considering the properness of using RCT. The authors set a higher diagnostic accuracy for senior consultants than AI in the initial study design of sample size estimation, which meant they believed the performance of AI was not superior to that of senior experts. Even if the results of the study were positive, it would not be able to confirm the efficacy of AI and put it into \u201cmarket.\u201d We recommend adopting a non-inferior design to confirm that AI is not inferior to seniors by setting an acceptable non-inferiority margin say 5% of diagnostic accuracy [3] . In the case where this condition is met and taking account of AI\u2019s advantages such as faster decision-making and lower-cost than seniors, if the non-inferiority was demonstrated, AI can be invested in the clinical settings where senior consultants are lacking. Further reading of the article identified an additional issue about study design that require attention. They reported that experts providing diagnosis were blinded to the group assignments to help prevent ascertainment bias. However, the study showed that the diagnostic accuracy from these experts were 4.1% higher than the estimated",

            "paperAbstract": "Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have generated a steep interest from media and general public. As AI systems (e.g. robots, chatbots, avatars and other intelligent agents) are moving from being perceived as a tool to being perceived as autonomous agents and team-mates, an important focus of research and development is understanding the ethical impact of these systems. What does it mean for an AI system to make a decision? What are the moral, societal and legal consequences of their actions and decisions? Can an AI system be held accountable for its actions? How can these systems be controlled once their learning capabilities bring them into states that are possibly only remotely linked to their initial, designed, setup? Should such autonomous innovation in commercial systems even be allowed, and how should use and development be regulated? These and many other related questions are currently the focus of much attention. The way society and our systems will be able to deal with these questions will for a large part determine our level of trust, and ultimately, the impact of AI in society, and the existence of AI. Contrary to the frightening images of a dystopic future in media and popular fiction, where AI systems dominate the world and is mostly concerned with warfare, AI is already changing our daily lives mostly in ways that improve human health, safety, and productivity (Stone et al. 2016). This is the case in domain such as transportation; service robots; health-care; education; public safety and security; and entertainment. Nevertheless, and in order to ensure that those dystopic futures do not become reality, these systems must be introduced in ways that build trust and understanding, and respect human and civil rights. The need for ethical considerations in the development of intelligent interactive systems is becoming one of the main influential areas of research in the last few years, and has led to several initiatives both from researchers as from practitioners, including the IEEE initiative on Ethics of Autonomous Systems1, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics2, and the Partnership on AI3 amongst several others. As the capabilities for autonomous decision making grow, perhaps the most important issue to consider is the need to rethink responsibility (Dignum 2017). Whatever their level of autonomy and social awareness and their ability to learn, AI systems are artefacts, constructed by people to fulfil some goals. Theories, methods, algorithms are needed to integrate societal, legal and moral values into technological developments in AI, at all stages of development (analysis, design, construction, deployment and evaluation). These frameworks must deal both with the autonomic reasoning of the machine about such issues that we consider to have ethical impact, but most importantly, we need frameworks to guide design choices, to regulate the reaches of AI systems, to ensure proper data stewardship, and to help individuals determine their own involvement. Values are dependent on the socio-cultural context (Turiel 2002), and are often only implicit in deliberation processes, which means that methodologies are needed to elicit the values held by all the stakeholders, and to make these explicit can lead to better understanding and trust on artificial autonomous systems. That is, AI reasoning should be able to take into account societal values, moral and ethical considerations; weigh the respective priorities of values held by different stakeholders in various multicultural contexts; explain its reasoning; and guarantee transparency. Responsible Artificial Intelligence is about human responsibility for the development of intelligent systems along fundamental human principles and values, to ensure human flourishing and wellbeing in a sustainable world. In fact, Responsible AI is more than the ticking of some ethical \u2018boxes\u2019 in a report, or the development of some add-on features, or switch-off buttons in AI systems. Rather, responsibility is fundamental",

            "paperAbstract": "While collective intelligence (CI) is a powerful approach to increase decision accuracy, few attempts have been made to unlock its potential in medical decision-making. Here we investigated the performance of three well-known collective intelligence rules (\u201cmajority\u201d, \u201cquorum\u201d, and \u201cweighted quorum\u201d) when applied to mammography screening. For any particular mammogram, these rules aggregate the independent assessments of multiple radiologists into a single decision (recall the patient for additional workup or not). We found that, compared to single radiologists, any of these CI-rules both increases true positives (i.e., recalls of patients with cancer) and decreases false positives (i.e., recalls of patients without cancer), thereby overcoming one of the fundamental limitations to decision accuracy that individual radiologists face. Importantly, we find that all CI-rules systematically outperform even the best-performing individual radiologist in the respective group. Our findings demonstrate that CI can be employed to improve mammography screening; similarly, CI may have the potential to improve medical decision-making in a much wider range of contexts, including many areas of diagnostic imaging and, more generally, diagnostic decisions that are based on the subjective interpretation of evidence.",

            "paperAbstract": "With recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, computer\u2010aided diagnosis (CAD) for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is gaining increasing attention. Main research focuses in this field include automated identification of dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus and detection of early gastric cancers. By helping endoscopists avoid missing and mischaracterizing neoplastic change in both the esophagus and the stomach, these technologies potentially contribute to solving current limitations of gastroscopy. Currently, optical diagnosis of early\u2010stage dysplasia related to Barrett's esophagus can be precisely achieved only by endoscopists proficient in advanced endoscopic imaging, and the false\u2010negative rate for detecting gastric cancer is approximately 10%. Ideally, these novel technologies should work during real\u2010time gastroscopy to provide on\u2010site decision support for endoscopists regardless of their skill; however, previous studies of these topics remain ex vivo and experimental in design. Therefore, the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of CAD for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in clinical practice remain unknown, although a considerable number of pilot studies have been conducted by both engineers and medical doctors with excellent results. This review summarizes current publications relating to CAD for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy from the perspective of endoscopists and aims to indicate what is required for future research and implementation in clinical practice.",

More recently, a wide variety of functions and physiologic variables, such as heart rate, hours of sleep, number of steps walked and movement, have been available through wristbands or watches. New data, hydration, geolocation, and barometric pressure, among others, will be incorporated in the future. All these parameters, when analyzed, can be helpful for patients and doctors\u2019 decision support. Similar new scenarios have appeared in most medical fields, in such a way that in recent years, there has been an increased interest in the development and application of the methods of artificial intelligence (AI) to decision support and knowledge acquisition. Multidisciplinary research teams integrated by computer engineers and doctors are more and more frequent, mirroring the need of cooperation in this new topic. AI, as a science, can be defined as the ability to make computers do things that would require intelligence if done by humans. Increasingly, diabetes-related journals have been incorporating publications focused on AI tools applied to diabetes. In summary, diabetes management scenarios have suffered a deep transformation that forces diabetologists to incorporate skills from new areas. This recently needed knowledge includes AI tools, which have become part of the diabetes health care. The aim of this article is to explain in an easy and plane way the most used AI methodologies to promote the implication of health care providers\u2014doctors and nurses\u2014in this field.",

A variety of ethical, legal and safety-based frameworks have been proposed as a basis for designing these constraints. Despite their variations, these frameworks share the common characteristic that decision-making must consider multiple potentially conflicting factors. We demonstrate that these alignment frameworks can be represented as utility functions, but that the widely used Maximum Expected Utility (MEU) paradigm provides insufficient support for such multiobjective decision-making. We show that a Multiobjective Maximum Expected Utility paradigm based on the combination of vector utilities and non-linear action\u2013selection can overcome many of the issues which limit MEU\u2019s effectiveness in implementing aligned AI. We examine existing approaches to multiobjective AI, and identify how these can contribute to the development of human-aligned intelligent agents.",

BDF prescribes rates and weights for 7 data layers but FCF is an unsupervised learning framework based on a multicriteria decision theory by integrating fuzzy membership function and catastrophe theory. The challenges in the paper include: (i) the study area comprises confined and unconfined aquifers and (ii) Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to run Multiple Framework (AIMF) in order to map specific vulnerability due to a specific contaminant. Predicted results by AIMF are referred to as Specific Vulnerability Indices, as the learned VIs are referenced to site-specific nitrate-N. The results show that correlation coefficient between BDF or FCF with nitrate-N is lower than 0.7 but the AIMF strategy improves it to greater than 0.95. The results are evidence for the proof-of-concept for transforming frameworks to models capable of further learning.",

In this paper, we examine how \u2018computational rationality\u2019 may be understood as intensifying of an instrumental set of logics in educational governance and decision making, and/or as opening up new explorations around the uncertainty and incompleteness of policy. We suggest that policy rationalities focused on prediction, transparency and data provide the conditions of possibility for Artificial Intelligence to be integrated into, and intensify aspects of, what we term \u2018computational education policy\u2019.",

            "paperAbstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in medicine and in particular in respiratory medicine is an increasingly relevant topic. Areas covered We aimed to identify and describe the studies published on the use of AI and ML in the field of respiratory diseases. The string \u2018(((pulmonary) OR respiratory)) AND ((artificial intelligence) OR machine learning)\u2019 was used in PubMed as a search strategy. The majority of studies identified corresponded to the area of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in particular to COPD and chest computed tomography scans, interpretation of pulmonary function tests, exacerbations and treatment. Another field of interest is the application of AI and ML to the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease, and a few other studies were identified on the fields of mechanical ventilation, interpretation of images on chest X-ray and diagnosis of bronchial asthma. Expert opinion ML may help to make clinical decisions but will not replace the physician completely. Human errors in medicine are associated with large financial losses, and many of them could be prevented with the help of AI and ML. AI is particularly useful in the absence of conclusive evidence of decision-making.",

            "title": "Multiobjective Markov chains optimization problem with strong Pareto frontier: Principles of decision making",
            "paperAbstract": "We formulate a regularized penalty function solution for the multi-objective constrained problem.We prove that exists a solution of the original problem with minimal weighted norm which is unique.We suggest a projection-gradient algorithm for computing the penalty function.We prove the convergence of the gradient method and the rate of convergence.We present a method that make the Pareto frontier more useful as decision support system. In this paper, we present a novel approach for computing the Pareto frontier in Multi-Objective Markov Chains Problems (MOMCPs) that integrates a regularized penalty method for poly-linear functions. In addition, we present a method that make the Pareto frontier more useful as decision support system: it selects the ideal multi-objective option given certain bounds. We restrict our problem to a class of finite, ergodic and controllable Markov chains. The regularized penalty approach is based on the Tikhonov's regularization method and it employs a projection-gradient approach to find the strong Pareto policies along the Pareto frontier. Different from previous regularized methods, where the regularizator parameter needs to be large enough and modify (some times significantly) the initial functional, our approach balanced the value of the functional using a penalization term (\u00b5) and the regularizator parameter (\u017a) at the same time improving the computation of the strong Pareto policies. The idea is to optimize the parameters \u00b5 and \u017a such that the functional conserves the original shape. We set the initial value and then decrease it until each policy approximate to the strong Pareto policy. In this sense, we define exactly how the parameters \u00b5 and \u017a tend to zero and we prove the convergence of the gradient regularized penalty algorithm. On the other hand, our policy-gradient multi-objective algorithms exploit a gradient-based approach so that the corresponding image in the objective space gets a Pareto frontier of just strong Pareto policies. We experimentally validate the method presenting a numerical example of a real alternative solution of the vehicle routing planning problem to increase security in transportation of cash and valuables. The decision-making process explored in this work correspond to the most frequent computational intelligent models applied in practice within the Artificial Intelligence research area.",

            "paperAbstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods have emerged as powerful tools to transform medical care. Although machine learning classifiers (MLCs) have already demonstrated strong performance in image-based diagnoses, analysis of diverse and massive electronic health record (EHR) data remains challenging. Here, we show that MLCs can query EHRs in a manner similar to the hypothetico-deductive reasoning used by physicians and unearth associations that previous statistical methods have not found. Our model applies an automated natural language processing system using deep learning techniques to extract clinically relevant information from EHRs. In total, 101.6 million data points from 1,362,559 pediatric patient visits presenting to a major referral center were analyzed to train and validate the framework. Our model demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy across multiple organ systems and is comparable to experienced pediatricians in diagnosing common childhood diseases. Our study provides a proof of concept for implementing an AI-based system as a means to aid physicians in tackling large amounts of data, augmenting diagnostic evaluations, and to provide clinical decision support in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or complexity. Although this impact may be most evident in areas where healthcare providers are in relative shortage, the benefits of such an AI system are likely to be universal.A natural language processing system can support physicians in diagnostic assessments by extracting clinical information from electronic medical records to accurately predict diagnosis in pediatric patients.",

Considering the hypercorrect approach to patients in all departments, \u2018data\u2019 and \u2018experience\u2019 offer the described care if syncretized properly (1). This notion combining the power of data and experience has to be absorbed in order to comprehend artificial intelligence (AI) and its implementation in medical sciences. In the past, the practical medical information can only be reached by using textbooks, journals formatting the guidelines and expert opinion including master-apprentice relationship. In addition, physicians gain experience by directing patient treatments and observing the outcomes. It appears as a great limitation to digest this large amount of knowledge and experience to provide the targeted patient care. AI has already come forward to assist by blending the large amount of patient data to promote and elaborate the effectiveness of the physicians (2). If we ask the accurate questions, AI has the potential to reveal the remarkable information hidden in the big data, which may have a role in clinical decisions (3).",

            "paperAbstract": "A fully operative and efficient 5G network cannot be complete without the inclusion of artificial intelligence (AI) routines. Existing 4G networks with all-IP (Internet Protocol) broadband connectivity are based on a reactive conception, leading to a poorly efficiency of the spectrum. AI and its subcategories like machine learning and deep learning have been evolving as a discipline, to the point that nowadays this mechanism allows fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks to be predictive and proactive, which is essential in making the 5G vision conceivable. This paper is motivated by the vision of intelligent base stations making decisions by themselves, mobile devices creating dynamically-adaptable clusters based on learned data rather than pre-established and fixed rules, that will take us to a improve in the efficiency, latency, and reliability of the current and real-time network applications in general. An exploration of the potential of AI-based solution approaches in the context of 5G mobile and wireless communications technology is presented, evaluating the different challenges and open issues for future research.",

            "paperAbstract": "In the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era, billions of sensors and devices collect and process data from the environment, transmit them to cloud centers, and receive feedback via the Internet for connectivity and perception. However, transmitting massive amounts of heterogeneous data, perceiving complex environments from these data, and then making smart decisions in a timely manner are difficult. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, is now a proven success in various areas, including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. AI introduced into the IoT heralds the era of AI of things (AIoT). This article presents a comprehensive survey on AIoT to show how AI can empower the IoT to make it faster, smarter, greener, and safer. Specifically, we briefly present the AIoT architecture in the context of cloud computing, fog computing, and edge computing. Then, we present progress in AI research for IoT from four perspectives: 1) perceiving; 2) learning; 3) reasoning; and 4) behaving. Next, we summarize some promising applications of AIoT that are likely to profoundly reshape our world. Finally, we highlight the challenges facing AIoT and some potential research opportunities.",

BDF prescribes rates and weights for 7 data layers but FCF is an unsupervised learning framework based on a multicriteria decision theory by integrating fuzzy membership function and catastrophe theory. The challenges in the paper include: (i) the study area comprises confined and unconfined aquifers and (ii) Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to run Multiple Framework (AIMF) in order to map specific vulnerability due to a specific contaminant. Predicted results by AIMF are referred to as Specific Vulnerability Indices, as the learned VIs are referenced to site-specific nitrate-N. The results show that correlation coefficient between BDF or FCF with nitrate-N is lower than 0.7 but the AIMF strategy improves it to greater than 0.95. The results are evidence for the proof-of-concept for transforming frameworks to models capable of further learning.",

By linking the VIS and AI representation, it is possible to predict the performance of the operations system under different decision-making strategies and to search for improved strategies. The KBI methodology is applied to the decision-making surrounding unplanned maintenance operations at a Ford Motor Company engine assembly plant.",

The further advancement of extended waterfall and agile models in the main phases like communication, planning, modelling, construction and deployment can improve the overall quality of the product. Accordingly, in this study, artificial intelligence (AI) activities are integrated into SW development processes. The important AI activities like intelligent agents, machine learning (ML), knowledge representation, statistical model, probabilistic methods, and fuzzy are integrated into the extended waterfall model. Again, AI activities like intelligent decision making, ML, Turing test, search and optimisation are integrated into the agile model. Two metrics such as, Usability Goals Achievement Metric and Index of Integration are evaluated in five independent SW projects. Once SW projects are developed using these models, feedback queries have been collected formally and the collected data are extensively analysed to identify the individual characteristics of products, identifying correlation behaviour of products with respect to model and metrics.",

            "paperAbstract": "In this article, we review the use of Artificial Intelligence to provide intelligent dispute resolution support. In the early years there was little systematic development of such systems. Rather a number of ad hoc systems were developed. The focus of these systems was upon the technology being utilised, rather than user needs. Following a review of historic systems, we focus upon what are the important components of intelligent Online Dispute Resolution systems. Arising from this review, we develop an initial model for constructing user centric intelligent Online Dispute Resolution systems. Such a model integrates Case management, Triaging, Advisory tools, Communication tools, Decision Support Tools and Drafting software. No single dispute is likely to require all six processes to resolve the issue at stake. However, the development of such a hybrid ODR system would be very significant important starting point for expanding into a world where Artificial Intelligence is gainfully used.",

            "paperAbstract": "CONTEXT.\u2014\nNodal metastasis of a primary tumor influences therapy decisions for a variety of cancers. Histologic identification of tumor cells in lymph nodes can be laborious and error-prone, especially for small tumor foci.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE.\u2014\nTo evaluate the application and clinical implementation of a state-of-the-art deep learning-based artificial intelligence algorithm (LYmph Node Assistant or LYNA) for detection of metastatic breast cancer in sentinel lymph node biopsies.\n\n\nDESIGN.\u2014\nWhole slide images were obtained from hematoxylin-eosin-stained lymph nodes from 399 patients (publicly available Camelyon16 challenge dataset). LYNA was developed by using 270 slides and evaluated on the remaining 129 slides. We compared the findings to those obtained from an independent laboratory (108 slides from 20 patients/86 blocks) using a different scanner to measure reproducibility.\n\n\nRESULTS.\u2014\nLYNA achieved a slide-level area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 99% and a tumor-level sensitivity of 91% at 1 false positive per patient on the Camelyon16 evaluation dataset. We also identified 2 \"normal\" slides that contained micrometastases. When applied to our second dataset, LYNA achieved an AUC of 99.6%. LYNA was not affected by common histology artifacts such as overfixation, poor staining, and air bubbles.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS.\u2014\nArtificial intelligence algorithms can exhaustively evaluate every tissue patch on a slide, achieving higher tumor-level sensitivity than, and comparable slide-level performance to, pathologists. These techniques may improve the pathologist's productivity and reduce the number of false negatives associated with morphologic detection of tumor cells. We provide a framework to aid practicing pathologists in assessing such algorithms for adoption into their workflow (akin to how a pathologist assesses immunohistochemistry results).",

            "paperAbstract": "Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation technologies have the potential to significantly disrupt labor markets. While AI and automation can augment the productivity of some workers, they can replace the work done by others and will likely transform almost all occupations at least to some degree. Rising automation is happening in a period of growing economic inequality, raising fears of mass technological unemployment and a renewed call for policy efforts to address the consequences of technological change. In this paper we discuss the barriers that inhibit scientists from measuring the effects of AI and automation on the future of work. These barriers include the lack of high-quality data about the nature of work (e.g., the dynamic requirements of occupations), lack of empirically informed models of key microlevel processes (e.g., skill substitution and human\u2013machine complementarity), and insufficient understanding of how cognitive technologies interact with broader economic dynamics and institutional mechanisms (e.g., urban migration and international trade policy). Overcoming these barriers requires improvements in the longitudinal and spatial resolution of data, as well as refinements to data on workplace skills. These improvements will enable multidisciplinary research to quantitatively monitor and predict the complex evolution of work in tandem with technological progress. Finally, given the fundamental uncertainty in predicting technological change, we recommend developing a decision framework that focuses on resilience to unexpected scenarios in addition to general equilibrium behavior.",

            "paperAbstract": "A survey is given which focuses on research issues involving strategic planning and artificial intelligence (AI), including the nature of the formulation task, cognitive studies of strategic planners and computer-based support for strategic planning. The author reviews the research to date, and argues that, like traditional decision support systems (DSS) research, much of the potential for future research in this area lies in modeling the ill-structured, early stages of the strategic decision making process namely, the strategic intelligence analysis and the issue diagnosis. Therefore, he discusses a specific model-based approach to the study of these early stages. Research in artificial intelligence-including investigations into diagnosis and situation assessment, analogical reasoning, plan recognition, nonmonotonic reasoning and distributed intelligence, among others-can be used to build models of strategic decision making that help researchers in better understanding this traditionally unstructured activity. >",

The different aspects of uncertainty (observational, prevalence and validity) play an important role in both human and computer-based decision-making processes, as do relationships between the components of knowledge. The design of an AI consultant system is discussed in terms of the way uncertainty is expressed and in how many parameters, the way uncertainty is propagated (Bayes, certainty factors, Dempster-Schafer, logic or Pathfinder heuristic methods), whether the system reasons from data to a conclusion or vice versa and what the aim of the system is. The suitability of an AI tool is determined by the knowable facts of the pathology subfield, by the match with its knowledge structure and by its requirements. While the success of an AI tool will partly depend on an appropriate definition of its scope, the appropriate combinatoric also depends on the expertise of the user.",

            "paperAbstract": "This paper presents an architecture which combines artificial neural networks (ANNs) and an expert system (ES) into a hybrid, self-improving artificial intelligence (AI) system. The purpose of this project is to explore methods of combining multiple AI technologies into a hybrid intelligent diagnostic and advisory system. ANNs and ESs have different strengths and weaknesses, which can be exploited in such a way that they are complementary to each other: strengths in one system make up for weaknesses in the other, andvice versa. There is, presently, considerable interest in ways to exploit the strengths of these methodologies to produce an intelligent system which is more robust and flexible than one using either technology alone. Any process which involves both data-driven (bottom-up) and concept-driven (top-down) processing is especially well suited to displaying the capabilities of such a hybrid system. The system can take an incoming pattern of signals, as from various points in an automated manufacturing process, and make intelligent process control decisions on the basis of the pattern as preprocessed by the ANNs, with rule-based heuristic help or corroboration from the ES. Patterns of data from the environment which can be classified by either the ES or a human consultant can result in a high-level ANN being created and trained to recognize that pattern on future occurrences. In subsequent cases in which the ANN and the ES fail to agree on a decision concerning the environmental situation, the system can resolve those differences and retrain the networks and/or modify the models of the environment stored in the ES. Work on a hybrid system for perception in machine vision has been funded initially by an Oak Ridge National Laboratory seed grant, and most of the system components are operating presently in a parallel distributed computer environment.",

            "paperAbstract": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to support clinical medical decisions is a rather promising concept. There are two important factors that have driven these advances: the availability of data from electronic health records (EHR) and progress made in computational performance. These two concepts are interrelated with respect to complex mathematical functions such as machine learning (ML) or neural networks (NN). Indeed, some published articles have already demonstrated the potential of these approaches in medicine. When considering the diagnosis and management of pneumonia, the use of AI and chest X-ray (CXR) images primarily have been indicative of early diagnosis, prompt antimicrobial therapy, and ultimately, better prognosis. Coupled with this is the growing research involving empirical therapy and mortality prediction, too. Maximizing the power of NN, the majority of studies have reported high accuracy rates in their predictions. As AI can handle large amounts of data and execute mathematical functions such as machine learning and neural networks, AI can be revolutionary in supporting the clinical decision-making processes. In this review, we describe and discuss the most relevant studies of AI in pneumonia.",

This paper provides a discussion on some issues that need to be addressed to handle potential future risks and provides some new perspectives. The development of artificial intelligence is moving from relatively limited standalone to large-scale, complex distributed systems. However, potential risks such as malfunction, malicious attacks and mismatch of objective can occur from hardware and software failures or design errors. Moreover, a system controlled by high level AI can become unpredictable in its behaviours and thus ethical risks can emerge when such systems have to make a decision related to operational issues. Given that all new, disruptive, technologies have risks associated with them, what we need to do, as practitioners and users, is to find ways of mitigating those risks. We discuss applications of agent-based simulation to illustrate some of the risks and, potentially, how to mitigate them.",

The exponential amount of data and information produced by human activities, exchanged through machine to machine transactions and captured on the web is available, but not always relevant for decision making. Artificial Intelligence techniques are used to discover knowledge from multimedia data, but without a systematic knowledge management this data is insufficient for right decision taking, especially in critical situations. After presenting some main crisis and risks this paper focus on decision making process based on exploration of available knowledge. An example of decision making in industrial design is given and discussed. Conclusions and perspectives for future extensions are given at the end.",

            "paperAbstract": "The information systems (IS) literature has long emphasized the positive impact of information provided by business intelligence systems (BIS) on decision-making, particularly when organizations operate in highly competitive environments. Evaluating the effectiveness of BIS is vital to our understanding of the value and efficacy of management actions and investments. Yet, while IS success has been well-researched, our understanding of how BIS dimensions are interrelated and how they affect BIS use is limited. In response, we conduct a quantitative survey-based study to examine the relationships between maturity, information quality, analytical decision-making culture, and the use of information for decision-making as significant elements of the success of BIS. Statistical analysis of data collected from 181 medium and large organizations is combined with the use of descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling. Empirical results link BIS maturity to two segments of information quality, namely content and access quality. We therefore propose a model that contributes to understanding of the interrelationships between BIS success dimensions. Specifically, we find that BIS maturity has a stronger impact on information access quality. In addition, only information content quality is relevant for the use of information while the impact of the information access quality is non-significant. We find that an analytical decision-making culture necessarily improves the use of information but it may suppress the direct impact of the quality of the information content.",

            "paperAbstract": "Objective To evaluate the design characteristics of studies that evaluated the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for the diagnostic analysis of medical images. Materials and Methods PubMed MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched to identify original research articles published between January 1, 2018 and August 17, 2018 that investigated the performance of AI algorithms that analyze medical images to provide diagnostic decisions. Eligible articles were evaluated to determine 1) whether the study used external validation rather than internal validation, and in case of external validation, whether the data for validation were collected, 2) with diagnostic cohort design instead of diagnostic case-control design, 3) from multiple institutions, and 4) in a prospective manner. These are fundamental methodologic features recommended for clinical validation of AI performance in real-world practice. The studies that fulfilled the above criteria were identified. We classified the publishing journals into medical vs. non-medical journal groups. Then, the results were compared between medical and non-medical journals. Results Of 516 eligible published studies, only 6% (31 studies) performed external validation. None of the 31 studies adopted all three design features: diagnostic cohort design, the inclusion of multiple institutions, and prospective data collection for external validation. No significant difference was found between medical and non-medical journals. Conclusion Nearly all of the studies published in the study period that evaluated the performance of AI algorithms for diagnostic analysis of medical images were designed as proof-of-concept technical feasibility studies and did not have the design features that are recommended for robust validation of the real-world clinical performance of AI algorithms.",

            "paperAbstract": "BACKGROUND\nIn recent studies, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) outperformed dermatologists in distinguishing dermoscopic images of melanoma and nevi. In these studies, dermatologists and artificial intelligence were considered as opponents. However, the combination of classifiers frequently yields superior results, both in machine learning and among humans. In this study, we investigated the potential benefit of combining human and artificial intelligence for skin cancer classification.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing 11,444 dermoscopic images, which were divided into five diagnostic categories, novel deep learning techniques were used to train a single CNN. Then, both 112 dermatologists of 13 German university hospitals and the trained CNN independently classified a set of 300 biopsy-verified skin lesions into those five classes. Taking into account the certainty of the decisions, the two independently determined diagnoses were combined to a new classifier with the help of a gradient boosting method. The primary end-point of the study was the correct classification of the images into five designated categories, whereas the secondary end-point was the correct classification of lesions as either benign or malignant (binary classification).\n\n\nFINDINGS\nRegarding the multiclass task, the combination of man and machine achieved an accuracy of 82.95%. This was 1.36% higher than the best of the two individual classifiers (81.59% achieved by the CNN). Owing to the class imbalance in the binary problem, sensitivity, but not accuracy, was examined and demonstrated to be superior (89%) to the best individual classifier (CNN with 86.1%). The specificity in the combined classifier decreased from 89.2% to 84%. However, at an equal sensitivity of 89%, the CNN achieved a specificity of only 81.5% INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that the combination of human and artificial intelligence achieves superior results over the independent results of both of these systems.",

            "paperAbstract": "Landslide is one of the most important geomorphological hazards that cause significant ecological and economic losses and results in billions of dollars in financial losses and thousands of casualties per year. The occurrence of landslide in northern Iran (Alborz Mountain Belt) is often due to the geological and climatic conditions and tectonic and human activities. To reduce or control the damage caused by landslides, landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) and landslide risk assessment are necessary. In this study, the efficiency and integration of frequency ratio (FR) and random forest (RF) in statisticaland artificial intelligence-based models and different digital elevation models (DEMs) with various spatial resolutions were assessed in the field of LSM. The experiment was performed in Sangtarashan watershed, Mazandran Province, Iran. The study area, which extends to 1072.28 km2, is severely affected by landslides, which cause severe economic and ecological losses. An inventory of 129 landslides that occurred in the study area was prepared using various resources, such as historical landslide records, the interpretation of aerial photos and Google Earth images, and extensive field surveys. The inventory was split into training and test sets, which include 70 and 30% of the landslide locations, respectively. Subsequently, 15 topographic, hydrologic, geologic, and environmental landslide conditioning factors were selected as predictor variables of landslide occurrence on the basis of literature review, field works and multicollinearity analysis. Phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR), ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer), and SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEMs were used to extract topographic and hydrologic attributes. The RF model showed that land use/land cover (16.95), normalised difference vegetation index (16.44), distance to road (15.32) and elevation (13.6) were the most important controlling variables. Assessment of model performance by calculating the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve parameter showed that FR\u2013RF integrated model (0.917) achieved higher predictive accuracy than the individual FR (0.865) and RF (0.840) models. Comparison of PALSAR, ASTER, and SRTM DEMs with 12.5, 30 and 90 m spatial resolution, respectively, with the FR\u2013RF integrated model showed that the prediction accuracy of FR\u2013RF\u2013PALSAR (0.917) was higher than FR\u2013RF\u2013ASTER (0.865) and FR\u2013RF\u2013SRTM (0.863). The results of this study could be used by local planners and decision makers for planning development projects and landslide hazard mitigation measures.",

            "paperAbstract": "The interpretation of pulmonary function tests (PFTs) to diagnose respiratory diseases is built on expert opinion that relies on the recognition of patterns and the clinical context for detection of specific diseases. In this study, we aimed to explore the accuracy and interrater variability of pulmonologists when interpreting PFTs compared with artificial intelligence (AI)-based software that was developed and validated in more than 1500 historical patient cases. 120 pulmonologists from 16 European hospitals evaluated 50 cases with PFT and clinical information, resulting in 6000 independent interpretations. The AI software examined the same data. American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines were used as the gold standard for PFT pattern interpretation. The gold standard for diagnosis was derived from clinical history, PFT and all additional tests. The pattern recognition of PFTs by pulmonologists (senior 73%, junior 27%) matched the guidelines in 74.4\u00b15.9% of the cases (range 56\u201388%). The interrater variability of \u03ba=0.67 pointed to a common agreement. Pulmonologists made correct diagnoses in 44.6\u00b18.7% of the cases (range 24\u201362%) with a large interrater variability (\u03ba=0.35). The AI-based software perfectly matched the PFT pattern interpretations (100%) and assigned a correct diagnosis in 82% of all cases (p<0.0001 for both measures). The interpretation of PFTs by pulmonologists leads to marked variations and errors. AI-based software provides more accurate interpretations and may serve as a powerful decision support tool to improve clinical practice. There is poor accuracy and substantial disagreement between pulmonologists when interpreting complex pulmonary function data. Automating interpretation with artificial intelligence provides a powerful decision support tool in clinical practice. http://ow.ly/Tj9h30nxw4U",

            "paperAbstract": "This paper presents an architecture which combines artificial neural networks (ANNs) and an expert system (ES) into a hybrid, self-improving artificial intelligence (AI) system. The purpose of this project is to explore methods of combining multiple AI technologies into a hybrid intelligent diagnostic and advisory system. ANNs and ESs have different strengths and weaknesses, which can be exploited in such a way that they are complementary to each other: strengths in one system make up for weaknesses in the other, andvice versa. There is, presently, considerable interest in ways to exploit the strengths of these methodologies to produce an intelligent system which is more robust and flexible than one using either technology alone. Any process which involves both data-driven (bottom-up) and concept-driven (top-down) processing is especially well suited to displaying the capabilities of such a hybrid system. The system can take an incoming pattern of signals, as from various points in an automated manufacturing process, and make intelligent process control decisions on the basis of the pattern as preprocessed by the ANNs, with rule-based heuristic help or corroboration from the ES. Patterns of data from the environment which can be classified by either the ES or a human consultant can result in a high-level ANN being created and trained to recognize that pattern on future occurrences. In subsequent cases in which the ANN and the ES fail to agree on a decision concerning the environmental situation, the system can resolve those differences and retrain the networks and/or modify the models of the environment stored in the ES. Work on a hybrid system for perception in machine vision has been funded initially by an Oak Ridge National Laboratory seed grant, and most of the system components are operating presently in a parallel distributed computer environment.",

The processing of imaging data is described at 4 levels of increasing complexity and wider implications. At the examination level, AI aims at improving, simplifying, and standardizing image acquisition and processing. Systems for AI-driven automatic patient iso-centering before a computed tomography (CT) scan, patient-specific adaptation of image acquisition parameters, and creation of optimized and standardized visualizations, for example, automatic rib-unfolding, are discussed. At the reading and reporting levels, AI focuses on automatic detection and characterization of features and on automatic measurements in the images. A recently introduced AI system for chest CT imaging is presented that reports specific findings such as nodules, low-attenuation parenchyma, and coronary calcifications, including automatic measurements of, for example, aortic diameters. At the prediction and prescription levels, AI focuses on risk prediction and stratification, as opposed to merely detecting, measuring, and quantifying images. An AI-based approach for individualizing radiation dose in lung stereotactic body radiotherapy is discussed. The digital twin is presented as a concept of individualized computational modeling of human physiology, with AI-based CT-fractional flow reserve modeling as a first example. Finally, at the cohort and population analysis levels, the focus of AI shifts from clinical decision-making to operational decisions.",

This paper provides a discussion on some issues that need to be addressed to handle potential future risks and provides some new perspectives. The development of artificial intelligence is moving from relatively limited standalone to large-scale, complex distributed systems. However, potential risks such as malfunction, malicious attacks and mismatch of objective can occur from hardware and software failures or design errors. Moreover, a system controlled by high level AI can become unpredictable in its behaviours and thus ethical risks can emerge when such systems have to make a decision related to operational issues. Given that all new, disruptive, technologies have risks associated with them, what we need to do, as practitioners and users, is to find ways of mitigating those risks. We discuss applications of agent-based simulation to illustrate some of the risks and, potentially, how to mitigate them.",

The exponential amount of data and information produced by human activities, exchanged through machine to machine transactions and captured on the web is available, but not always relevant for decision making. Artificial Intelligence techniques are used to discover knowledge from multimedia data, but without a systematic knowledge management this data is insufficient for right decision taking, especially in critical situations. After presenting some main crisis and risks this paper focus on decision making process based on exploration of available knowledge. An example of decision making in industrial design is given and discussed. Conclusions and perspectives for future extensions are given at the end.",

On one hand, AI technologies, such as deep learning, can be introduced into cyber security to construct smart models for implementing malware classification and intrusion detection and threating intelligence sensing. On the other hand, AI models will face various cyber threats, which will disturb their sample, learning, and decisions. Thus, AI models need specific cyber security defense and protection technologies to combat adversarial machine learning, preserve privacy in machine learning, secure federated learning, etc. Based on the above two aspects, we review the intersection of AI and cyber security. First, we summarize existing research efforts in terms of combating cyber attacks using AI, including adopting traditional machine learning methods and existing deep learning solutions. Then, we analyze the counterattacks from which AI itself may suffer, dissect their characteristics, and classify the corresponding defense methods. Finally, from the aspects of constructing encrypted neural network and realizing a secure federated deep learning, we expatiate the existing research on how to build a secure AI system.",

This article identifies four challenges in using data science techniques for HR tasks: complexity of HR phenomena, constraints imposed by small data sets, accountability questions associated with fairness and other ethical and legal constraints, and possible adverse employee reactions to management decisions via data-based algorithms. It then proposes practical responses to these challenges based on three overlapping principles\u2014causal reasoning, randomization and experiments, and employee contribution\u2014that would be both economically efficient and socially appropriate for using data science in the management of employees.",

However, this bright future has a dark side: a dramatic job market contraction before its unpredictable transformation. Hence, in a near future, large numbers of job seekers will need financial support while catching up with these novel unpredictable jobs. This possible job market crisis has an antidote inside. In fact, the rise of AI is sustained by the biggest knowledge theft of the recent years. Learning AI machines are extracting knowledge from unaware skilled or unskilled workers by analyzing their interactions. By passionately doing their jobs, these workers are digging their own graves. In this paper, we propose Human-in-the-loop Artificial Intelligence (HIT-AI) as a fairer paradigm for Artificial Intelligence systems. HIT-AI will reward aware and unaware knowledge producers with a different scheme: decisions of AI systems generating revenues will repay the legitimate owners of the knowledge used for taking those decisions. As modern Robin Hoods, HIT-AI researchers should fight for a fairer Artificial Intelligence that gives back what it steals.",

            "paperAbstract": "Background: Authors have been advocating the research ideology that a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system trained using lots of patient data and physiological signals and images based on adroit integration of advanced signal processing and artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning techniques in an automated fashion can assist neurologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, and other medical providers to make better clinical decisions. Summary: This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of research on automated diagnosis of 5 neurological disorders in the past 2 decades using AI techniques: epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, and ischemic brain stroke using physiological signals and images. Recent research articles on different feature extraction methods, dimensionality reduction techniques, feature selection, and classification techniques are reviewed. Key Message: CAD systems using AI and advanced signal processing techniques can assist clinicians in analyzing and interpreting physiological signals and images more effectively.",

            "paperAbstract": "Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in many fields of medicine, assisting physicians in most steps of patient management. In nephrology, artificial intelligence can already be used to improve clinical care, hemodialysis prescriptions, and follow-up of transplant recipients. However, many nephrologists are still unfamiliar with the basic principles of medical artificial intelligence. This review seeks to provide an overview of medical artificial intelligence relevant to the practicing nephrologist, in all fields of nephrology. We define the core concepts of artificial intelligence and machine learning and cover the basics of the functioning of neural networks and deep learning. We also discuss the most recent clinical applications of artificial intelligence in nephrology and medicine; as an example, we describe how artificial intelligence can predict the occurrence of progressive immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Finally, we consider the future of artificial intelligence in clinical nephrology and its impact on medical practice, and conclude with a discussion of the ethical issues that the use of artificial intelligence raises in terms of clinical decision making, physician-patient relationship, patient privacy, and data collection.",

            "paperAbstract": "Across the natural world, many species have evolved methods for amplifying their decision-making accuracy by thinking together in real-time closed-loop systems. Known as Swarm Intelligence (SI) in the field of biology, the process has been deeply studied in schools of fish, flocks of bird, and swarms of bees. The present research looks at human groups and tests their ability to make financial predictions by forming online systems modeled after natural swarms. Specifically, groups of financial traders were tasked with predicting the weekly trends of four common market indices (SPX, GLD, GDX, and Crude Oil) over a period of 14 consecutive weeks. Results showed that individual participants, who averaged 61% accuracy when predicting weekly trends on their own, amplified their accuracy to 77% when predicting together as real-time swarms. These results reflect a 26% increase in financial prediction accuracy and show high statistical significance (p=0.001). This suggests that enabling groups of traders to form real-time systems online, governed by swarm intelligence algorithms, has the potential to significantly increase the accuracy of financial forecasts.",

The robots have enhanced controllers that realize AI functions, such as perception (information extraction) and cognition (decision making). Historically, controllers have been based on general-purpose CPUs, and only recently, a few perception SoCs have been reported. SoCs with cognition capability have not been reported thus far, even though cognition is a key AI function in micro robots for decision making, especially autonomous drones. Path planning and obstacle avoidance require more than 10,000 searches within 50ms for a fast response, but a software implementation running on a Cortex-M3 takes ~5s to make decisions. Micro robots require 10\u00d7 lower power and 100\u00d7 faster decision making than conventional robots because of their fast movement in the environment, small form factor, and limited battery capacity. Therefore, an ultra-low-power high-performance artificial-intelligence processor (AIP) is necessary for micro robots to make fast and smart maneuvers in dynamic environments filled with obstacles.",

To assess the role of AI in women\u2019s health, discover gaps, and discuss the future of AI in maternal health. A systematic review of English articles using EMBASE, PubMed, and SCOPUS. Search terms included pregnancy and AI. Research articles and book chapters were included, while conference papers, editorials and notes were excluded from the review. Included papers focused on pregnancy and AI methods, and pertained to pharmacologic interventions. We identified 376 distinct studies from our queries. A final set of 31 papers were included for the review. Included papers represented a variety of pregnancy concerns and multidisciplinary applications of AI. Few studies relate to pregnancy, AI, and pharmacologics and therefore, we review carefully those studies. External validation of models and techniques described in the studies is limited, impeding on generalizability of the studies. Our review describes how AI has been applied to address maternal health, throughout the pregnancy process: preconception, prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal health concerns. However, there is a lack of research applying AI methods to understand how pharmacologic treatments affect pregnancy. We identify three areas where AI methods could be used to improve our understanding of pharmacological effects of pregnancy, including: (a) obtaining sound and reliable data from clinical records (15 studies), (b) designing optimized animal experiments to validate specific hypotheses (1 study) to (c) implementing decision support systems that inform decision-making (11 studies). The largest literature gap that we identified is with regards to using AI methods to optimize translational studies between animals and humans for pregnancy-related drug exposures.",

            "paperAbstract": "Over the past decade rapid advancements in molecular imaging (MI) and artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized traditional musculoskeletal radiology. Molecular imaging refers to the ability of various methods to in vivo characterize and quantify biological processes, at a molecular level. The extracted information provides the tools to understand the pathophysiology of diseases and thus to early detect, to accurately evaluate the extend and to apply and evaluate targeted treatments. At present, molecular imaging mainly involves CT, MRI, radionuclide, US, and optical imaging and has been reported in many clinical and preclinical studies. Although originally MI techniques targeted at central nervous system disorders, later on their value on musculoskeletal disorders was also studied in depth. Meaningful exploitation of the large volume of imaging data generated by molecular and conventional imaging techniques, requires state-of-the-art computational methods that enable rapid handling of large volumes of information. AI allows end-to-end training of computer algorithms to perform tasks encountered in everyday clinical practice including diagnosis, disease severity classification and image optimization. Notably, the development of deep learning algorithms has offered novel methods that enable intelligent processing of large imaging datasets in an attempt to automate decision-making in a wide variety of settings related to musculoskeletal trauma. Current applications of AI include the diagnosis of bone and soft tissue injuries, monitoring of the healing process and prediction of injuries in the professional sports setting. This review presents the current applications of novel MI techniques and methods and the emerging role of AI regarding the diagnosis and evaluation of musculoskeletal trauma.",

            "paperAbstract": "It is well-known that machine learning algorithms can be susceptible to undesirable effects when exposed to conditions that are not expressed adequately in the training dataset. This leads to a growing interest throughout many communities; where do algorithms and trained models break? Recently, methods such as generative adversarial neural networks and variational autoencoders were proposed to create adversarial examples that challenge algorithms. This results in artificial intelligence having higher false detections or completely losing recognition. The problem is that existing solutions, are for the most part, black boxes. Current gaps include how do we better control and understand adversarial algorithms. Herein, we propose the concept of an adversarial modifier set as an understandable and controlled way to generate adversarial examples. This is achieved by exploiting the improved evolution-constructed algorithm to identify ideal features that a victim algorithm values in imagery. These features are combined to realize a tuple library that preserves spatial relations. Last, a set of algorithmically controlled modifiers that generate the imagery are found by examining the content of the false imagery. Preliminary results are encouraging and demonstrate that this approach has benefits in both generating explainable adversarial examples, as well as shedding some insight into victim algorithm decision making.",

This paper provides a systematic literature review on articles published from 2008 to 2012 on the application of DM techniques for supplier selection. By using a methodological decision analysis in four aspects including decision problems, decision makers, decision environments, and decision approaches, we finally selected and reviewed 123 journal articles. To examine the research trend on uncertain supplier selection, these articles are roughly classified into seven categories according to different uncertainties. Under such classification framework, 26 DM techniques are identified from three perspectives: (1) Multicriteria decision making (MCDM) techniques, (2) Mathematical programming (MP) techniques, and (3) Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. We reviewed each of the 26 techniques and analyzed the means of integrating these techniques for supplier selection. Our survey provides the recommendation for future research and facilitates knowledge accumulation and creation concerning the application of DM techniques in supplier selection.",

            "paperAbstract": "Artificial intelligence has seen a number of breakthroughs in recent years, with games often serving as significant milestones. A common feature of games with these successes is that they involve information symmetry among the players, where all players have identical information. This property of perfect information, though, is far more common in games than in real-world problems. Poker is the quintessential game of imperfect information, and it has been a longstanding challenge problem in artificial intelligence. In this paper we introduce DeepStack, a new algorithm for imperfect information settings such as poker. It combines recursive reasoning to handle information asymmetry, decomposition to focus computation on the relevant decision, and a form of intuition about arbitrary poker situations that is automatically learned from selfplay games using deep learning. In a study involving dozens of participants and 44,000 hands of poker, DeepStack becomes the first computer program to beat professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold\u2019em. Furthermore, we show this approach dramatically reduces worst-case exploitability compared to the abstraction paradigm that has been favored for over a decade.",

Preferences are a central concept for decision making and have extensively been studied in disciplines such as economy, operational research, decision analysis, psychology and philosophy. However, in the recent years it has also become an important topic both for research and applications in Computer Science and more specifically in Artificial Intelligence, in fields spanning from recommender systems to automatic planning, from non monotonic reasoning to computational social choice and algorithmic decision theory. The survey essentially covers the basics of preference modelling, the use of preference in reasoning and argumentation, the problem of compact representations of preferences, preference learning and the use of non conventional preference models based on extended logical languages. It aims at providing a general reference for all researchers both in Artificial Intelligence and Decision Analysis interested in this exciting interdisciplinary topic.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract\nThe paper presents and discusses a system (xDriver) which uses an Intelligent System of Decision-making (ISD) for the task of car driving. The principal subject is the implementation, simulation and testing of the ISD system described earlier in our publications (Kowalczuk and Czubenko in artificial intelligence and soft computing lecture notes in computer science, lecture notes in artificial intelligence, Springer, Berlin, 2010, 2010, In Int J Appl Math Comput Sci 21(4):621\u2013635, 2011, In Pomiary Autom Robot 2(17):60\u20135, 2013) for the task of autonomous driving. The design of the whole ISD system is a result of a thorough modelling of human psychology based on an extensive literature study. Concepts somehow similar to the ISD system can be found in the literature (Muhlestein in Cognit Comput 5(1):99\u2013105, 2012; Wiggins in Cognit Comput 4(3):306\u2013319, 2012), but there are no reports of a system which would model the human psychology for the purpose of autonomously driving a car. The paper describes assumptions for simulation, the set of needs and reactions (characterizing the ISD system), the road model and the vehicle model, as well as presents some results of simulation. It proves that the xDriver system may behave on the road as a very inexperienced driver.",

Forty participants, both male and female, who scored in either the highest or the lowest quartiles of an EI measure (the Trait Meta-Mood Scale) completed the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and the Iowa Gambling Task. As expected, main effects for gender and EI level occurred, as women outperformed men on the Eyes Test, and participants in the higher EI group outperformed those in the lower EI group on the Eyes Test. Additionally, men classified in the higher EI group performed significantly better on the Eyes Test than men in the lower EI group. However, no group or gender differences were found on the Iowa Gambling Task.",

            "paperAbstract": "Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are networks of nodes equipped with cognitive radios that can optimize performance by adapting to network conditions. Although various routing protocols incorporating varying degrees of adaptiveness and cognition have been proposed for CRNs, these works have mostly been limited by their system-level focus (that emphasizes optimization at the level of an individual cognitive radio system). The vision of CRNs as cognitive networks, however, requires that the research focus progresses from its current system-level fixation to the a network-wide optimization focus. This motivates the development of cognitive routing protocols envisioned as routing protocols that fully and seamlessly incorporate artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques into their design. In this paper, we provide a self-contained exposition of various decision-theoretic and learning techniques from the field of AI and machine-learning that are relevant to the problem of cognitive routing in CRNs. Apart from providing necessary background, we present for each technique discussed in this paper their application in the context of CRNs in general and for the routing problem in particular. We also highlight challenges associated with these techniques and common pitfalls. Finally, open research issues and future directions of work are identified.",

            "paperAbstract": "STUDY DESIGN\nRetrospective review of prospectively-collected, multicenter adult spinal deformity (ASD) databases.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo apply artificial intelligence (AI)-based hierarchical clustering as a step toward a classification scheme that optimizes overall quality, value, and safety for ASD surgery.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA\nPrior ASD classifications have focused on radiographic parameters associated with patient reported outcomes. Recent work suggests there are many other impactful preoperative data points. However, the ability to segregate patient patterns manually based on hundreds of data points is beyond practical application for surgeons. Unsupervised machine-based clustering of patient types alongside surgical options may simplify analysis of ASD patient types, procedures and outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwo prospective cohorts were queried for surgical ASD patients with baseline, 1-year, and 2-year SRS-22/ODI/SF-36v2 data. Two dendrograms were fitted, one with surgical features and one with patient characteristics. Both were built with Ward distances and optimized with the gap method. For each possible n patient cluster by m surgery, normalized 2-year improvement and major complication rates were computed.\n\n\nRESULTS\n570 patients were included. Three optimal patient types were identified: young with coronal plane deformity (YC, n\u200a=\u200a195), older with prior spine surgeries (ORev, n\u200a=\u200a157), and older without prior spine surgeries (OPrim, n\u200a=\u200a218). Osteotomy type, instrumentation and interbody fusion were combined to define 4 surgical clusters. The intersection of patient-based and surgery-based clusters yielded 12 subgroups, with major complication rates ranging from 0% to 51.8% and 2-year normalized improvement ranging from -0.1% for SF36v2 MCS in cluster [1,3] to 100.2% for SRS self-image score in cluster [2,1]).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnsupervised hierarchical clustering can identify data patterns that may augment preoperative decision making through construction of a 2-year risk-benefit grid. In addition to creating a novel AI-based ASD classification, pattern identification may facilitate treatment optimization by educating surgeons on which treatment patterns yield optimal improvement with lowest risk.\n\n\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE\n4.",

            "paperAbstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the latest trend being implemented in the public sector. Recent advances in this field and the AI explosion in the private sector have served to promote a revolution for government, public service management, accountability, and public value. Incipient research to understand, conceptualize and express challenges and limitations is now ongoing. This paper is the first approach in such a direction; our research question is: What are the current AI trends in the public sector? In order to achieve that goal, we collected 78 papers related to this new field in recent years. We also used a public policy framework to identify future areas of implementation for this trend. We found that only normative and exploratory papers have been published so far and there are a lot of public policy challenges facing in this area, and that AI implementation results are unknown and unexpected; since there may be great benefits for governments and society, but, on the other hand, it may have negative results like the so-called \u201dalgorithmic bias\u201d of AI when making important decisions for social development. However, we consider that AI has potential benefits in the public health, public policies on climate change, public management, decision-making, disaster prevention and response, improving government-citizen interaction, personalization of services, interoperability, analyzing large amounts of data, detecting abnormalities and patterns, and discovering new solutions through dynamic models and simulation in real time.",

Literature were searched from electronic databases of Scopus and Medline from 1993 to 2020 with English publications reported on the application of ANNs in spinal diseases. The search strategy was set as the combinations of the following keywords: \u201cartificial neural networks,\u201d \u201cspine,\u201d \u201cback pain,\u201d \u201cprognosis,\u201d \u201cgrading,\u201d \u201cclassification,\u201d \u201cprediction,\u201d \u201csegmentation,\u201d \u201cbiomechanics,\u201d \u201cdeep learning,\u201d and \u201cimaging.\u201d The main findings of the included studies were summarized, with an emphasis on the recent advances in spinal diseases and its application in the diagnostic and prognostic procedures. According to the search strategy, a set of 3,653 articles were retrieved from Medline and Scopus databases. After careful evaluation of the abstracts, the full texts of 89 eligible papers were further examined, of which 79 articles satisfied the inclusion criteria of this review. Our review indicates several applications of ANNs in the management of spinal diseases including (1) diagnosis and assessment of spinal disease progression in the patients with low back pain, perioperative complications, and readmission rate following spine surgery; (2) enhancement of the clinically relevant information extracted from radiographic images to predict Pfirrmann grades, Modic changes, and spinal stenosis grades on magnetic resonance images automatically; (3) prediction of outcomes in lumbar spinal stenosis, lumbar disc herniation and patient-reported outcomes in lumbar fusion surgery, and preoperative planning and intraoperative assistance; and (4) its application in the biomechanical assessment of spinal diseases. The evidence suggests that ANNs can be successfully used for optimizing the diagnosis, prognosis and outcome prediction in spinal diseases. Therefore, incorporation of ANNs into spine clinical practice may improve clinical decision making.",

This limitation suppresses the decision power of DT and can be overcome by using multivariate splitting criteria. This paper presents an improvement of splitting criteria searching in a decision tree based on swarm intelligence, the global optimization technique. JADE, one of swarm intelligent algorithms, is adapted in this work to search for optimal parameters for the multivariate linear splitting criteria in the multivariate decision tree building. This paper illustrates the splitting criteria in 2D data space and tests the efficiency of the created decision tree. The experimental results show that AJADE-MDT, the proposed algorithm could be used to create the decision tree with higher efficiency compared to the existing algorithms.",

BI is currently the top-most priority of many chief information officers. BI has become a strategic initiative and is now recognized by CIOs and business leaders as instrumental in driving business effectiveness and innovation. BI is a process that includes two primary activities: getting data in and getting data out. Getting data in, traditionally referred to as data warehousing, involves moving data from a set of source systems into an integrated data warehouse. Getting data in delivers limited value to an enterprise; only when users and applications access the data and use it to make decisions does the organization realize the full value from its data warehouse. Thus, getting data out receives most attention from organizations. This second activity, which is commonly referred to as BI, consists of business users and applications accessing data from the data warehouse to perform enterprise reporting, OLAP, querying, and predictive analytics.",

            "paperAbstract": "This paper critically analyses the nature and state of decision support systems (DSS) research. To provide context for the analysis, a history of DSS is presented which focuses on the evolution of a number of sub-groupings of research and practice: personal DSS, group support systems, negotiation support systems, intelligent DSS, knowledge management-based DSS, executive information systems/business intelligence, and data warehousing. To understand the state of DSS research an empirical investigation of published DSS research is presented. This investigation is based on the detailed analysis of 1,020 DSS articles published in 14 major journals from 1990 to 2003. The analysis found that DSS publication has been falling steadily since its peak in 1994 and the current publication rate is at early 1990s levels. Other findings include that personal DSS and group support systems dominate research activity and data warehousing is the least published type of DSS. The journal DSS is the major publishing outlet; US \u2018Other\u2019 journals dominate DSS publishing and there is very low exposure of DSS in European journals. Around two-thirds of DSS research is empirical, a much higher proportion than general IS research. DSS empirical research is overwhelming positivist, and is more dominated by positivism than IS research in general. Design science is a major DSS research category. The decision support focus of the sample shows a well-balanced mix of development, technology, process, and outcome studies. Almost half of DSS papers did not use judgement and decision-making reference research in the design and analysis of their projects and most cited reference works are relatively old. A major omission in DSS scholarship is the poor identification of the clients and users of the various DSS applications that are the focus of investigation. The analysis of the professional or practical contribution of DSS research shows a field that is facing a crisis of relevance. Using the history and empirical study as a foundation, a number of strategies for improving DSS research are suggested.",

            "paperAbstract": "This article deals with optimization problems to be solved in the absence of a full power computer device. The goal is to solve a complex optimization problem by using a control card related to portable devices, e.g. for the control of commercial robots. In order to handle this class of optimization problems, a novel Memetic Computing approach is presented. The proposed algorithm employs a Differential Evolution framework which instead of processing an actual population of candidate solutions, makes use of a statistical representation of the population which evolves over time. In addition, the framework uses a stochastic local search algorithm which attempts to enhance the performance of the elite. In this way, the memetic logic of performing the optimization by observing the decision space from complementary perspectives can be integrated within computational devices characterized by a limited memory. The proposed algorithm, namely Memetic compact Differential Evolution (McDE), has been tested and compared with other algorithms belonging to the same category for a real-world industrial application, i.e. the control system design of a cartesian robot for variable mass movements. For this real-world application, the proposed McDE displays high performance and has proven to considerably outperform other compact algorithms representing the current state-of-the-art in this sub-field of computational intelligence.",

            "paperAbstract": "Banks take great care when dealing with customer loans to avoid any improper decisions that can lead to loss of opportunity or financial losses. Regarding this, researchers have developed complex credit scoring models using statistical and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to help banks and financial institutions to support their financial decisions. Various models, from easy to advanced approaches, have been developed in this domain. However, during the last few years there has been marked attention towards development of ensemble or multiple classifier systems, which have proved their ability to be more accurate than single classifier models. However, among the multiple classifier systems models developed in the literature, there has been little consideration given to: 1) combining classifiers of different algorithms (as most have focused on building classifiers of the same algorithm); or 2) exploring different classifier output combination techniques other than the traditional ones, such as majority voting and weighted average. In this paper, the aim is to present a new combination approach based on classifier consensus to combine multiple classifier systems (MCS) of different classification algorithms. Specifically, six of the main well-known base classifiers in this domain are used, namely, logistic regression (LR), neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), decision trees (DT) and naive Bayes (NB). Two benchmark classifiers are considered as a reference point for comparison with the proposed method and the other classifiers. These are used in combination with LR, which is still considered the industry-standard model for credit scoring models, and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), a widely adopted technique in credit scoring studies. The experimental results, analysis and statistical tests demonstrate the ability of the proposed combination method to improve prediction performance against all base classifiers, namely, LR, MARS and seven traditional combination methods, in terms of average accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), the H-measure and Brier score (BS). The model was validated over five real-world credit scoring datasets.",

            "paperAbstract": "In the context of power system security assessment, automatic learning methods have been proposed along many different paradigms (statistics, neural nets, symbolic artificial intelligence, fuzzy systems). In order to solve various learning problems, different automatic learning methods are complementary and the best way to exploit large real data bases is to use a data mining tool-box approach. In this paper we argue that fuzzy decision tree induction promises to be a particularly attractive tool in this framework. It is indeed able to handle large scale problems, while combining interpretability with smooth interpolation capabilities. We describe a new algorithm able to infer fuzzy decision trees in domains where most of the input variables are numerical and output information is best characterized as a fuzzy set. It comprises three complementary steps: growing (selecting relevant attributes and fuzzy thresholds); pruning (determining the appropriate tree complexity); refitting (tuning the tree parameters in a global fashion). The basic features of the method are discussed from theoretical and practical viewpoints. Simulation results obtained in the context of transient stability assessment of a real system are provided in order to support our claims.",

            "paperAbstract": "The combination of Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques \"with Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offers a great deal of opportunities for practitioners and Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers alike. CI techniques provide the means to search massive spaces quickly; find possible, better or optimum solutions in these spaces; construct algorithms, functions and strategies to control an autonomous entity; find patterns and relationships \"within data, information, knowledge or experience; assess risk and identify strategies for risk treatment; and connect the dots to synthesize an overall situational awareness picture that decision makers can utilize. MAS provide the structured, modular, distributed and efficient software environment to simulate systems; the architecture to represent systems and entities naturally; the environment to allow entities to observe, communicate \"with, negotiate \"with, orient \"with respect to, and act upon other entities; the modular representation that allows entities to store and manipulate observations, forming beliefs, desires, goals, plans, and intentions; and the framework to model behavior. By bringing CI and MAS together, we have a powerful computational environment that has the theoretical potential to do many things that one can expect \"when attempting to structure, understand, and solve a problem. In this article, we follow two objectives. First, we \"will present Computational Red Teaming (CRT) as the state-of-the-art architecture representing the integration of CI techniques and MAS for understanding competition. Second, we \"will demonstrate how this integration of MAS and CI benefits practitioners in almost all major application domains by drawing examples from defense, business and engineering. We \"will present the evolution of CRT by categorizing the different levels of integrating CI and MAS, and highlighting open research questions pertaining to CRT.",

            "paperAbstract": "Previously works on analysing imperfect electricity markets have employed conventional game-theoretic approaches. However, such approaches necessitate that each strategic market player has full knowledge of the operating parameters and the strategies of its rivals as well as the computational algorithm of the market clearing process. This unrealistic assumption, along with the modeling and computational complexities, renders such approaches less applicable for conducting practical multi-period and multi-spatial equilibrium analysis. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MA-DRL) based methodology, combining multi-agent intelligence, the deep policy gradient (DPG) method, and an innovative long short term memory (LSTM) based representation network for optimizing the offering strategies of multiple self-interested generation companies (GENCOs) as well as exploring the market outcome stemming from their interactions. The proposed approach is tailored to align with the nature of the examined problem by posing it, for the first time, in multi-dimensional continuous state and action spaces, enabling GENCOs to receive accurate feedback regarding the impact of their offering strategies on the market clearing outcome, and devise more profitable bidding decisions by exploiting the entire action domain, and thereby facilitates more accurate equilibrium analysis. The proposed LSTM-based representation network extracts discriminative features which further improves the learning performance and thus promises more profitable offerings strategies for each GENCO. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method i) achieves a significantly higher profit than state-of-the-art RL methods for a single GENCO\u2019s optimal offering strategy problem and ii) outperforms the state-of-the-art equilibrium programming models in efficiently identifying an imperfect market equilibrium with/without network congestion. Quantitative economic analysis is carried out on the obtained equilibrium.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract Psychologists have convincingly demonstrated that preferences are not always stable and, instead, are often \u201cconstructed\u201d based on information available in the judgment or decision context. In 4 studies with experts (accountants and actuaries in Studies 1 and 2, respectively) and a diverse lay population (Studies 3 and 4), the evidence was consistent with the highly numerate being more likely than the less numerate to construct their preferences by rating a numerically inferior bet as superior (i.e., the bets effect). Thus, the effect generalizes beyond a college student sample, and preference construction differs by numeracy. Contrary to prior thinking about preference construction, however, high expertise and high ability (rather than low) consistently related to the paradoxical phenomenon. Results across studies including Study 3's experimental modifications of the task supported the hypothesized number comparison process (and not a lack of expertise with monetary outcomes and probabilities or numeracy\u2010related differences in attention to numbers) as the effect's underlying cause. The bets effect was not attenuated by Study 4's instructions to think about what would be purchased with bet winnings. Task results combined with free\u2010response coding supported the notion that highly numerate participants have a systematic and persistent inclination for doing simple and complex number operations that drive their judgments (even after controlling for nonnumeric intelligence). Implications for 3 types of dual\u2010process theories are discussed. The results were inconsistent with default\u2010interventionist theories, consistent or unclear with respect to fuzzy trace theory, and consistent with interactive theories.",

            "paperAbstract": "Match-to-sample is a timed task in which a subject is presented with a visual stimulus (the probe) and must select a match to that stimulus (the target) from among an array of distractors. These tasks are frequently employed as tests of basic cognitive abilities and demonstrate consistent correlations with measures of intelligence. In the current study, a match-to-sample task was modified to produce near-match conditions (trials for which no exact match existed). Two factors were manipulated: type of discrepancy between the target and probe (additive or subtractive) and degree of discrepancy between target and probe (1 element or 2 elements). It was hypothesized that introducing near-match conditions would change the processing demands of the task, resulting in increased correlations between decision time and fluid intelligence. Degree and type of discrepancy affected decision times: participants required more time for 2 element discrepancies and additive type discrepancies. Contrary to expectations, increased decision time on a task did not correspond to higher correlations with fluid intelligence. For type, correlations were larger when participants needed to mentally subtract elements from the target in order to make it match the probe (mean r(additive) = .399; mean r(subtractive) = .451). For degree, correlations were larger for trials where the probe and target differed by one element (mean r = .470) than for trials where the probe and target differed by two elements (mean r = .380). These results seem to indicate that the relationship between the complexity of a task and general intelligence is not as straightforward as has been commonly believed.",

            "title": "Expert Systems: Principles and Programming",
            "paperAbstract": "Expert Systems: Principles and Programming Joseph C. Giarratano and Gary D. Riley Fourth Edition, Course Technology, Boston, MA, 2004 856 pages, $131.95 Language: English ISBN: 0534384471 Expert systems is one of the most successful, practical, and recognizable subsets of classical Artificial Intelligence. The ability to supply decisions or descision-making support in a specific domain has seen a vast application of expert systems in various fields such as healthcare, military, business, accounting, production, video games, and human resources. The theoretical and practical knowledge of expert systems is indispensable for a computer science, management information science or software engineering student. In its fourth edition, Expert Systems: Principles and Programming, as the title suggests, aims to be used as a complete textbook on this topic. The authors are respected authorities on expert systems, and were involved in the development of the popular CLIPS expert system tool which is dealt with thoroughly in this book. The book itself is divided into two major sections: the first six chapters deal with the theory of expert systems, the rationale behind their historical development and the current state of research; the next six sections are an introduction to CLIPS and how to use it to develop practical applications. The clear division between theory and practice serves to guide the student in choosing specific topics throughout the book. Each chapter ends with a set of problems and a useful bibliography. Appendix G provides a comprehensive list of software resources and will prove to be a very valuable asset to the student interested in exploring the practical aspects of expert systems as well as those who will be developing commercial applications incorporating expert systems. The first six chapters provide an indepth intoduction to expert systems, and deal with the representation of knowledge and methods of inference and reasoning. Each of these topics are introduced from scratch\u2014for example, when dealing with knowledge representation, logic is described from its very basics, starting from propositional logic. The chapters on reasoning under uncertainty and inexact reasoning are very well constructed and are the most attractive feature of the book for me. Topics such as fuzzy logic and Dempster-Shafer theory are explained in good detail along with their practical significance. There is an objective flow through the chapters which helps to tie in the concepts and give an understanding on the progress of topics. Also, the disadvantages and pitfalls behind expert systems in general, and specific topics are well documented. The second section focusing on the CLIPS expert system tool is meant to be an aid in understanding and reinforcing the concepts of the first section, but does not require a thorough reading of the latter. CLIPS, developed in part by the authors at NASA, has become quite popular as a tool for studying expert system in many university courses as well as being used in several commercial and industrial applications. The expert system programming in CLIPS does not require much experience with programming and can be picked up rapidly thanks to its simple syntax and the helpful examples in the book. A new feature of the fourth edition is the introduction of COOL, the CLIPS Object-Oriented Language, which allows expert systems programmers to develop their systems in an object-oriented environment. The section is supplemented by a CD containing Windows and MacOS executables for CLIPS and reference guides\u2014all of which can be downloaded from the Internet as well. Although the CLIPS examples deal with some problems of uncertainty in reasoning, there is no mention of using fuzzy logic or Dempster-Shafer theory in a practical setting\u2014a serious disadvantage to the effectiveness of the book, considering the availability of tools such as FuzzyClips. The book itself is expensive\u2014on the wrong side of a hundred dollars, but that seems to be the trend for academic books these days and shouldn't be a deterrent to anyone interested in the subject considering it has become one of the standard textbooks on expert systems.

            "paperAbstract": "Credit scoring models have been widely studied in the areas of statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). Many novel approaches such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), rough sets, or decision trees have been proposed to increase the accuracy of credit scoring models. Since an improvement in accuracy of a fraction of a percent might translate into significant savings, a more sophisticated model should be proposed to significantly improving the accuracy of the credit scoring mode. In this paper, genetic programming (GP) is used to build credit scoring models. Two numerical examples will be employed here to compare the error rate to other credit scoring models including the ANN, decision trees, rough sets, and logistic regression. On the basis of the results, we can conclude that GP can provide better performance than other models.",

Oil spills are recognized by experts as dark patterns of characteristic shape, in particular context. The system analyzes the satellite images and assigns the probability of a dark image shape to be an oil spill. The output consists of several images and tables providing the user with all relevant information for decision-making. The case study area was the Aegean Sea in Greece. The system responded very satisfactorily for all 35 images processed. The complete algorithmic procedure was coded in MS Visual C++ 6.0 in a stand-alone dynamic link library (dll) to be linked with any sort of application under any variant of MS Windows operating system.",

This paper concentrates on understanding the modeled environment through model analysis. Specifically, the purpose of this paper is to propose a framework for model analysis based on Perkins's theory of understanding and its basic premise (knowledge as design) and basic components (purpose, models, and arguments). This framework encourages enhanced user understanding in a DSS via the synergistic combination and integration of: (1) cognitive science (theory of understanding), (2) artificial intelligence (machine learning, knowledge extraction, and expert systems), (3) model analysis (deductive and inductive), and (4) DSS (model management, instance management, and knowledge-base management).",

            "paperAbstract": "In the specific area of Software Engineering (SE) for self-adaptive systems (SASs) there is a growing research awareness about the synergy between SE and Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, just few significant results have been published so far. In this paper, we propose a novel and formal Bayesian definition of surprise as the basis for quantitative analysis to measure degrees of uncertainty and deviations of self-adaptive systems from normal behavior. A surprise measures how observed data affects the models or assumptions of the world during runtime. The key idea is that a \"surprising'' event can be defined as one that causes a large divergence between the belief distributions prior to and posterior to the event occurring. In such a case the system may decide either to adapt accordingly or to flag that an abnormal situation is happening. In this paper, we discuss possible applications of Bayesian theory of surprise for the case of self-adaptive systems using Bayesian dynamic decision networks.",

In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach for dynamic adaptation of game scenario difficulties. The goal is to fit the performance of the player to the desired conditions set by the designer. To this end, the data on player's in-game performance and dynamic game states are utilized for making adaptation decisions. Trained artificial neural networks are used to capture the relationship between dynamic game state, player performance, adaptation decision and the resultant game difficulty. Based on the predicted difficulty, adaptation of both direction and magnitude can be performed more effectively. Experimental study on a training game application is presented to demonstrate the efficiency and stability of the proposed approach.",

An important aspect in deciding a move is evaluating your opponentpsilas past moves and using them to predict future movement. In the game of TEMPO this is done through the purchase of intelligence, which gives you a relative view of your opponentpsilas choices. The research presented here seeks to evaluate the way this intelligence is used in the current game, and present an alternative method of representation. This alternate mechanism is then used in a co evolutionary system to obtain a computer player that will self-learn the importance of using opposition data in strategic decision making.",

The first step for the implementation of a BI system is the development of the ontology, which can be performed via an institutional glossary. However, usually the link between the ontology and the BI system is not direct, and therefore the implementation of the BI system may be slow. In this paper, we show the application of concept maps for BI system implementation. We exemplify this application using the study case of the implementation of the BI system for the Federal Property Department (SPU), which belongs to the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management (MP) in Brazil. Besides the efficient implementation via concept maps, the impacts of our proposed BI system are also highlighted in this paper.",

While the identification of efficient solutions is supported by computational intelligence techniques on the basis of local search, the search is directed by partial preference information obtained from the decision maker. An application of the approach to biobjective portfolio optimization, modeled as the well-known knapsack problem, is reported, and experimental results are reported for benchmark instances taken from the literature. In brief, we obtain encouraging results that show the applicability of the approach to the described problem. In order to stipulate a better understanding of the underlying structures of biobjective knapsack problems, we also study the characteristics of the search space of instances for which the optimal alternatives are known. As a result, optimal alternatives have been found to be relatively concentrated in alternative space, making the resolution of the studied instances possible with reasonable effort",

            "paperAbstract": "One of AI branch, Computer Vision-based recognition systems is necessary for security in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Traffic sign recognition systems are popularly used in AVs because it ensures driver safety and decrease vehicles accidents on roads. However, the inability of AVs to accurately detect road signs and pedestrian behaviour has led to road crashes and even death in recent times. Additionally, as cities become smarter, the traditional traffic signs dataset will change considerably, as theGoogle, 2020se vehicles and city infrastructure introduce modern facilities into their operation. In this paper, we introduce a computer vision based road surface marking recognition system to serve as an added layer of data source from which AVs will make decisions. We trained our detector using YOLOv3 running in the cloud to detect 25 classes of Road surface markings using over 25,000 images. The results of our experiment demonstrate a robust performance in terms of the accuracy and speed of detection. The results of which will consolidate the traffic sign recognition system, thereby ensuring more reliability and safety in AVs decision making. New algorithm using Deep Learning technology in Artificial intelligence (AI) application is implemented and tested successfully.",

            "paperAbstract": "The prostate-specific antigen test has been a major factor in increasing awareness and better patient management of prostate cancer (PCA), but its lack of specificity limits its use in diagnosis and makes for poor early detection of PCA. The objective of our studies is to identify better biomarkers for early detection of PCA using protein profiling technologies that can simultaneously resolve and analyze multiple proteins. Evaluating multiple proteins will be essential to establishing signature proteomic patterns that distinguish cancer from noncancer as well as identify all genetic subtypes of the cancer and their biological activity. In this study, we used a protein biochip surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry approach coupled with an artificial intelligence learning algorithm to differentiate PCA from noncancer cohorts. Surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry protein profiles of serum from 167 PCA patients, 77 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia, and 82 age-matched unaffected healthy men were used to train and develop a decision tree classification algorithm that used a nine-protein mass pattern that correctly classified 96% of the samples. A blinded test set, separated from the training set by a stratified random sampling before the analysis, was used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the classification system. A sensitivity of 83%, a specificity of 97%, and a positive predictive value of 96% for the study population and 91% for the general population were obtained when comparing the PCA versus noncancer (benign prostate hyperplasia/healthy men) groups. This high-throughput proteomic classification system will provide a highly accurate and innovative approach for the early detection/diagnosis of PCA.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract This study presents a hybrid AI (artificial intelligence) approach to the implementation of trading strategies in the S&P 500 stock index futures market. The hybrid AI approach integrates the rule-based systems technique and the neural networks technique to accurately predict the direction of daily price changes in S&P 500 stock index futures. By highlighting the advantages and overcoming the limitations of both the neural networks technique and rule-based systems technique, the hybrid approach can facilitate the development of more reliable intelligent systems to model expert thinking and to support the decision-making processes. Our methodology differs from other studies in two respects. First, the rule-based systems approach is applied to provide neural networks with training examples. Second, we employ Reasoning Neural Networks (RN) instead of Back Propagation Networks. Empirical results demonstrate that RN outperforms the other two ANN models (Back Propagation Networks and Perceptron). Based upon this hybrid AI approach, the integrated futures trading system (IFTS) is established and employed to trade the S&P 500 stock index futures contracts. Empirical results also confirm that IFTS outperformed the passive buy-and-hold investment strategy during the 6-year testing period from 1988 to 1993.",

The more realistic case where state information is only partially observable Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) have received much less attention. The best exact algorithms for these problems can be very inefficient in both space and time. We introduce Smooth Partially Observable Value Approximation (SPOVA), a new approximation method that can quickly yield good approximations which can improve over time. This method can be combined with reinforcement learning meth ods a combination that was very effective in our test cases.",

It is a game of imperfect knowledge, where multiple competing agents must deal with risk management, agent modeling, unreliable information and deception, much like decision-making applications in the real world. Agent modeling is one of the most difficult problems in decision-making applications and in poker it is essential to achieving high performance. This paper describes and evaluates Loki, a poker program capable of observing its opponents, constructing opponent models and dynamically adapting its play to best exploit patterns in the opponents' play.",

            "paperAbstract": "What is machine learning? Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence that uses computer algorithms to identify patterns in large data sets and can continuously improve with additional data. The resulting pattern algorithms can make predictions about future outcomes. The more commonly used machine learning algorithms include neural networks, support vector machines, and decision trees. Classification and regression trees (CARTs), boosting, and random forest fall under the category of decision trees and use computer algorithms to identify ways to separate large groups of individual cases into distinct categories of outcomes (life/ death, response/nonresponse, renewal of cell phone contract/non-renewal). Machine learning approaches are often applied in business situations in which large data sets are available, such as identification of which Internet banner advertisement an individual might respond to, which credit card offer will result in a new customer, and which items shoppers might also be interested in on the basis of their past purchase history (or even their history of mouse clicks while online). For example, Amazon.com uses a form of machine learning to identify consumer preferences for a certain product. These algorithms divide individuals into groups and measure how \u201cpure\u201d the divisions into groups are. Machine learning algorithms use mathematical approaches to optimize the purity of the groups (minimizing false positives and false negatives). One of the great advantages of machine learning is that many forms are \u201csemisupervised\u201d or \u201cunsupervised,\u201d in that the computer algorithms, once the outcome of interest and potential predictor variables are identified, can find optimized algorithms without significant input from a statistician to develop a model.",

            "paperAbstract": "This paper presents an intelligent simulation system for an earthquake disaster assessment system based on a development platform of a Geographic Information System (GIS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This system is designed to identify the weakness of the structure and infrastructure system in pre-earthquake conditions, quickly assess earthquake damage and make an intelligent emergency response for the public and government during the earthquake and post-earthquake. The system includes the following functions: intelligent seismic hazard assessment, earthquake damage and loss evaluation, optimizing emergency response and post-earthquake recovering plan. The principle, design criteria, structure, functions and test results of this system are described in this paper. Based on its functional characteristics, this system is composed of four parts: an information database, analytical modules, an intelligent decision-making sub-system and a friendly user interface. There are 132 coverages and 78 analytical modules included in the information database and analytical modules. With this system, seismic disaster mitigation strategies can be verified during a pre-earthquake, and be executed at the time of an earthquake and post-earthquake; the earthquake resisting capacities for an entire city and all of its communities can be greatly enhanced. To check its reliability and its efficiency, this system has been tested based on a scenario earthquake event in one city, and the related results have also been given in this paper. At the present, this system has been installed and used in Daqing City, China. After running for almost 10 years, this system has successfully been used in rehearsing of seismic disaster mitigation and post-earthquake emergency response. Simultaneously, an optimizing aseismic retrofitting plan in Daqing City has been executed based on results from this system.",

            "paperAbstract": "In the smart houses of the future, artificial intelligence will play a significant role in optimizing residents' every day life. It is envisioned that smart appliances in smart houses will work autonomously and make decisions by analyzing the house data. One important aspect of smart houses is the efficient consumption of electrical energy. To that end, there is a need for coordinating the smart appliances in a house in such a way that the energy consumption is efficient while the consumption cost remains as low as possible. In this paper, we present a new methodology for coordinating the energy consumption of smart appliances in smart homes to achieve a consumption efficiency. To that end the use of artificial intelligence technologies is essential. In particular, a smart system that integrates fuzzy logic inference with the notion of leaky bucket is proposed and tested. Results show that the proposed methodology automates the efficient scheduling of the smart appliances and subsequently achieves low consumption cost and prevents from unnecessary load morphing.",

A scoping review was presented following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. MEDLINE, Emerald, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched in July 2016 using uniform keywords for documents that discuss data mining and knowledge discovery, dashboards, geographical information systems, and electronic surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in surveillance systems. Our study mainly focused on knowledge discovery and visualization algorithms, methods, and techniques used in antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems. Thirteen of the reviewed articles applied algorithms to the data mining process. A comparative table of data elements in the reviewed studies was extracted. The characteristics of antimicrobial dashboards were discussed. Heat maps were the most popular method used to visualize the intensity of resistance. Comparative tables are provided in each section of this paper. Data mining, Decision Support Systems, Geographic Information Systems, and dashboards can be integrated for data analysis and to better solve decision support problems. Bio-surveillance systems should be designed and analyzed based on four categories: data mining, dashboards, geography information system, and decision support modules. Furthermore, some questionnaires and checklists were developed and validated to capture related Business Intelligence and analytical requirements. Future studies should focus on developing fast, flexible, and accurate computational bio-surveillance systems by appropriate selecting and applying the considered methods and algorithms.",

In contrast with currently predominant conversational agents, whose intelligence derives from dialogue trees and external modules, a fully autonomous domestic or workplace robot must carry out more complex reasoning. Such a robot must make good decisions as soon as possible, learn from experience, respond to feedback, and rely on feedback only as much as necessary. In this research, we narrow the focus of a hypothetical robot assistant to a room-tidying task in a simulated domestic environment. Given an item, the robot chooses where to put it among many destinations, then optionally receives feedback from a human operator. We frame the problem as a contextual bandit, a reinforcement learning approach frequently used in Web recommendation systems. We evaluate epsilon-greedy and LinUCB action selection methods under a variety of infrequent feedback scenarios, with several methods for managing the lack of feedback. Our empirical results show that, while early-episode performance and overall accuracy of epsilon-greedy action selection can be improved through learning from no-response feedback and careful management of remembered training episodes, a baseline LinUCB approach outperforms epsilon-greedy action selection in early-episode performance, overall accuracy, and simplicity.",

The more realistic case where state information is only partially observable Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) have received much less attention. The best exact algorithms for these problems can be very inefficient in both space and time. We introduce Smooth Partially Observable Value Approximation (SPOVA), a new approximation method that can quickly yield good approximations which can improve over time. This method can be combined with reinforcement learning meth ods a combination that was very effective in our test cases.",

            "paperAbstract": "Negotiation among multiple agents remains an important topic of research in Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI). Most previous work on this subject, however, has focused on bilateral negotiation, deals that are reached between two agents. There has also been research on n-agent agreement which has considered \"consensus mechanisms\" (such as voting), that allow the full group to coordinate itself. These group decision-making techniques, however, assume that the entire group will (or has to) coordinate its actions. Sub-groups cannot make sub-agreements that exclude other members of the group. \n \nIn some domains, however, it may be possible for beneficial agreements to be reached among sub-groups of agents, who might be individually motivated to work together to the exclusion of others outside the group. This paper considers this more general case of n-agent coalition formation. We present a simple coalition formation mechanism that uses cryptographic techniques for subadditive Task Oriented Domains. The mechanism is efficient, symmetric, and individual rational. When the domain is also concave, the mechanism also satisfies coalition rationality.",

            "paperAbstract": "Business intelligence (BI) applications within an enterprise range over enterprise reporting, cube and ad hoc query analysis, statistical analysis, data mining, and proactive report delivery and alerting. The most sophisticated applications of BI are statistical analysis and data mining, which involve mathematical and statistical treatment of data for correlation analysis, trend analysis, hypothesis testing, and predictive analysis. They are used by relatively small groups of users consisting of information analysts and power users, for whom data and analysis are their primary jobs. We present an ontology-based approach for BI applications, specifically in statistical analysis and data mining. We implemented our approach in financial knowledge management system (FKMS), which is able to do: (i) data extraction, transformation and loading, (ii) data cubes creation and retrieval, (iii) statistical analysis and data mining, (iv) experiment metadata management, (v) experiment retrieval for new problem solving. The resulting knowledge from each experiment defined as a knowledge set consisting of strings of data, model, parameters, and reports are stored, shared, disseminated, and thus helpful to support decision making. We finally illustrate the above claims with a process of applying data mining techniques to support corporate bonds classification.",

To address this problem, a bio-inspired swarm intelligence based algorithm is proposed for a distributed multi-robot system to combine explorative searching and dynamic task allocation together for collective construction. Basically, a virtual pheromone trail based method is proposed as the message passing mechanism among the robots, where robots make distributed movement decisions through local interactions. Since blocks may need multiple robots to work together, dynamic task allocation among robots is necessary. A modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method is proposed to balance the exploration and exploitation, which helps to allocate reasonable robots to different target blocks. The simulation results in multi-robot construction task demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method.",

This game, which has been chosen for the Google Artificial Intelligence Challenge in 2010, requires that the artificial player is able to deal with multiple objectives, while achieving a certain degree of adaptability in order to defeat different opponents in different scenarios. The decision engine of the bot is based on a set of rules that have been defined after an empirical study. Then, an Evolutionary Algorithm is used for tuning the set of constants, weights and probabilities that define the rules, and, therefore, the global behavior of the bot. The paper describes the Evolutionary Algorithm and the results attained by the decision engine when competing with other bots. The proposed bot defeated a baseline bot in most of the playing environments and obtained a ranking position in top-20% of the Google Artificial Intelligence competition.",

This paper introduces a cognitively enhanced complex event processing (CECEP) architecture to enable enhanced agent-based decision making. Additionally the paper examines the parallelization and acceleration of a key knowledge mining process within the architecture on high performance computing platforms. Speedups of almost a 1000 times were seen using 8 NVIDIA Tesla C2070 GPGPUs over 1 Xeon X5650 processor core. Speedups of this level will allow more complex knowledge domains to be searched in real time on reactive agents and thus enable systems with enhanced intelligence to be designed.",

            "paperAbstract": "At present, artificial intelligence (AI) has made considerable progress in recognition of speech, face, and emotion. Potential application to robots could bring significant improvement on intelligent robotic systems. However, limited resource on robots cannot satisfy the large-scale computation and storage that the AI recognition requires. Cloud provides an efficient way for robots, where they off-load the computation too. Therefore, we present a cognition-based context-aware cloud computing framework, which is designed to help robot\u2019s sense environments including user\u2019s emotions. Based on the recognized context information, robots could optimize their responses and improve the user\u2019s experience on interaction. The framework contains a customizable context monitoring system on the mobile end to collect and process the data from the robot\u2019s sensors. Besides, it integrates various AI recognition services in the cloud to extract the context facts by analyzing and understanding the data. Once the context data is extracted, the results are pushed back to mobile end for making a better decision in the next interactions. In this paper, we demonstrate and evaluate the framework by a real case, an educational mobile app for English learning. The results show that the proposed framework could significantly improve the interaction and intelligence of mobile robots.",

            "paperAbstract": "In the smart houses of the future, artificial intelligence will play a significant role in optimizing residents' every day life. It is envisioned that smart appliances in smart houses will work autonomously and make decisions by analyzing the house data. One important aspect of smart houses is the efficient consumption of electrical energy. To that end, there is a need for coordinating the smart appliances in a house in such a way that the energy consumption is efficient while the consumption cost remains as low as possible. In this paper, we present a new methodology for coordinating the energy consumption of smart appliances in smart homes to achieve a consumption efficiency. To that end the use of artificial intelligence technologies is essential. In particular, a smart system that integrates fuzzy logic inference with the notion of leaky bucket is proposed and tested. Results show that the proposed methodology automates the efficient scheduling of the smart appliances and subsequently achieves low consumption cost and prevents from unnecessary load morphing.",

            "paperAbstract": "This paper describes a new Decision Infrastructure for Counterinsurgency Operational Planning (DICOP). DICOP facilitates the cognitive processes of the command team by providing a method for organizing relevant situational data, visualizing and modeling operational factors, assessing uncertainty and risk, and identifying and planning courses of action that are likely to provide the greatest utility. DICOP is organized around three main components: Mission Analysis; Mission Modeling; and Mission Planning. Mission Analysis provides a method for rapidly organizing and analyzing incoming intelligence and situational information. Mission Modeling provides a structure for constructing campaign models (lines of effort, objectives, and end states), using doctrinal templates, assessing the impact of situational factors, and associating intelligence information with the model. Mission Planning supports resource to task allocation, scheduling, and order generation. Initial positive evaluation by US Army command personnel has shown that DICOP is a powerful tool that fits the needs of the counterinsurgency planning team. Users highlighted three key cognitive features: (1) the ability to explicitly represent and manipulate operational factors in a modeling framework, (2) the ability to directly associate intelligence in support for or against those factors, and (3) numerical measures of utility and risk for different courses of action. The paper describes the DICOP cognitive rationale, its functional features, its initial evaluation, and the plans for further empirical evaluation in an operational environment.",

The DW process, though supporting bottom-up extraction of information from data, fails in top-down enforcing the company strategy. A new approach to BI, called Business Performance Management (BPM), is emerging from this framework: it includes DW but it also requires a reactive component capable of monitoring the time-critical operational processes to allow tactical and operational decision-makers to tune their actions according to the company strategy. The aim of this paper is to encourage the research community to acknowledge the coming of a second era in BI, to propose a general architecture for BPM, and to lay the premises for investigating the most challenging of the related issues.",

These knowledge sources are then combined to direct the decisions of the individual agents in solving optimization problems using an influence function inspired by the marginal value theorem from population biology. We briefly describe an implementation of this approach, the cultural algorithms toolkit (CAT) in the Repast agent-based simulation environment. Next we introduce the notion of \"social fabric\" which provides a framework in which the knowledge sources can access the social networks to which individuals can belong. A computational version of the social fabric idea is then implemented as an extension of the influence function in the CAT system. We then apply the enhanced system to a problem in engineering design, the \"pressure vessel problem\". For this problem, we show that the enhanced system with the social fabric outperforms the CAT system without it. We demonstrate also that the frequency with which the knowledge sources are able to access the network can affect the problem solving process.",

A known NP-complete problem, 3-exact cover, is used to prove that this problem is NP-complete. One prevalent classification algorithm in machine learning, ID3, is evaluated. The greedy search procedure used by ID3 is found to create anomalous behavior with inferior decision trees on a lot of occasions. A decision-tree classification algorithm, the intelligent decision-tree algorithm (IDA), that overcomes these anomalies with better classification performance is presented. A time analysis shows that IDA is more computationally efficient than ID3, and a simulation study indicates that IDA outperforms ID3.<<ETX>>",

The aim is to show how program (based on evolutionary algorithms) can replace a man in the strategy game StarCraft: Brood War. Implementation used in our experiments use classic techniques of artificial intelligence environments, as well as unconventional techniques, such as evolutionary computation. An artificial player, proposed in this paper, is the combination of the decision tree and evolutionary algorithm SOMA. Whole code for experiments was written in the Java programming language. The proposed code provides a simple implementation of the artificial computer player in combination with slightly modified algorithm SOMA. This provides an opportunity for effective, coordinated movement of combat units around the combat landscape. Research reported here has shown potential benefit of evolutionary computation in the field of strategy games.",

            "paperAbstract": "This paper examines stock prices forecasting and trading strategies' development with means of computational intelligence (CI), addressing the issue of an artificial neural network (ANN) topology dependency. \n \nSimulations reveal optimal network settings. Optimality of discovered ANN topologies' is explained through their links with the ARMA processes, thus presenting identified structures as nonlinear generalizations of such processes. Optimal settings examination demonstrates the weak relationships between statistical and economic criteria. \n \nThe research demonstrates that fine-tuning ANN settings is an important stage in the computational model set-up for results' improvement and mechanism understanding. Genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to be used for model discovery, making technical decisions less arbitrary and adding additional explanatory power to the analysis of economic systems with CI. \n \nThe paper is a step towards the econometric foundation of CI in finance. The choice of evaluation criteria combining statistical and economic qualities is viewed as essential for an adequate analysis of economic systems.",

            "paperAbstract": "Real Time Strategy (RTS) games are interesting from an Artificial Intelligence (AI) point of view because they involve a huge range of decision making from local tactical decisions to broad strategic considerations, all of which occur on a densely populated and fiercely contested map. However, most RTS AI used in commercial RTS games are predictable and can be exploited by expert players. Adaptive or evolutionary AI techniques offer the potential to create challenging AI opponents. Neural Evolution of Augmenting Technologies (NEAT) is a hybrid approach that applies Genetic Algorithm (GA) techniques to increase the efficiency of learning neural nets. This work presents an application of NEAT to RTS AI. It does so through a set of experiments in a realistic RTS environment. The results of the experiments show that NEAT can produce satisfactory RTS agents, and can also create agents capable of displaying complex in-game adaptive behavior. The results are significant because they show that NEAT can be used to evolve sophisticated RTS AI opponents without significant designer input or expertise, and without extensive databases of existing games.",

            "paperAbstract": "The growing energy demand and environmental concerns have increased interests of academia, industry, and governments in the development of a smart electric power grid. While the existing power grid has served us well in the past, innovative technologies and solutions are needed to realize an intelligent smart grid providing affordable, reliable, sustainable, efficient, and secure supply of electricity. Among many efforts toward this goal, computational intelligence research offers key technical solutions to accomplish this goal. This special issue aims at presenting the state-of-the-art research with a focus on algorithms, architectures, applications needed for the development of a smart grid. Our goal is not only to introduce readers to the cutting-edge research results, but also to present critical visionary discussions and highlights for future computational intelligence research in smart grid. All contributions submitted to this special issue have been subject to a rigorous peer-review process, leading to the selection of four articles covering different aspects of computational intelligence in smart gr id research and development. In the opening feature article, Werbos presents a review of the evolution of the four generation of concepts of smart grid with a focus on contributions of the computational intelligence research to smart grid. The article shows that computational intelligence has played a critical role in four generations of smart grid. The first generation focused on the traditional concepts such as automated meters while the second generation focused on global control systems and stability issues. The new third and fourth generations of smart grid target an intelligent power grid operating in a sustainable global energy system. Critical components such as electric vehicles, renewable energy, storage, distributed intelligence and new computational intelligence tools providing key capabilities to handle the complexity and stochastic challenges of a smart grid have been discussed. This paper reviews the critical technical solutions needed for the smart grid development, and presents important opportunities and visionary discussions for the community for new fundamental research of computational intelligence for smart grid. In his paper, Venayagamoorthy outlines contributions of computational intelligence in developing dynamic, stochastic, and scalable technologies needed for sense-making, situational awareness, control, and optimization of a smart grid. The development of an intelligent power grid has been hampered by its complexity (e.g., spatial and temporal dependencies, nonlinearity, non-stationarity, uncertainties) far exceeding those in traditional power systems. The paper indicates that computational intelligence tools ranging from neural networks to swarm intelligence could play a critical role in many aspects of a smart grid, such as prediction of system states, stochastic power flow, and system optimization. In the third paper, Hu et al. presents a belief propagation (BP) based distribution system state estimator for smart grid development. Versed in computational intelligence, their approach overcomes the limitations of the traditional power system state estimations by using the BP approach to deal with sparse measurements. The presented probabilistic inference approach derives first and second order statistics of the state variables given prior distributions and real-time measurements. The article suggests that the BP solution can bridge the gap between the transmission state estimation and real-time feeder analysis leading to a potential usage in a smart micro-grid. The fourth paper by Felice and Yao presents a comparative study of shortterm load forecasting with neural network ensembles. Load forecasting has been widely recognized to be a critical component in management, scheduling, and dispatching operations in power systems. In an intelligent power grid, reliable and accurate forecasting of loads could provide vital information for system optimization and control, as well as decision-making in energy generation and dynamic pricing. In this article, a neural network ensemble has been investigated for hourly prediction of energy load based on data coming from seven office buildings located in Rome, Italy. We hope the four selected papers illustrate essential aspects of computational intelligence research in smart",

            "title": "Toward Human Level Machine Intelligence - Is It Achievable? The Need for a Paradigm Shift",
            "paperAbstract": "Officially, AI was born in 1956. Since then, very impressive progress has been made in many areas - but not in the realm of human level machine intelligence. During much of its early history, AI \"was rife \"with exaggerated expectations. A headline in an article published in the late forties of last century was headlined, \"Electric brain capable of translating foreign languages is being built\". Today, more than half a century later, we do have translation software, but nothing that can approach the quality of human translation. Clearly, achievement of human level machine intelligence is a challenge that is hard to meet. A prerequisite to achievement of human level machine intelligence is mechanization of these capabilities and, in particular, mechanization of natural language understanding. To make significant progress toward achievement of human level machine intelligence, a paradigm shift is needed. More specifically, what is needed is an addition to the armamentarium of AI of two methodologies: (a) a nontraditional methodology of computing with words (CW) or more generally, NL-Computation; and (b) a countertraditional methodology \"which involves a progression from computing with numbers to computing with words. The centerpiece of these methodologies is the concept of precisiation of meaning. Addition of these methodologies to AI would be an important step toward the achievement of human level machine intelligence and its applications in decision-making, pattern recognition, analysis of evidence, diagnosis, and assessment of causality. Such applications have a position of centrality in our infocentric society.",

A key component of our methodology is developing AI systems in complex, dynamic environments that have many of the properties of the world we inhabit. Although robotics might seem an obvious choice, research in robotics requires solving many difficult problems related to low-level sensing and acting in the real world that are far removed from the cognitive aspects of intelligence. Simulated virtual environments make it possible to by-pass many of these problems, while preserving the need for intelligent real-time decision-making and interaction. Unfortunately, development of realistic virtual environments is an expensive and timeconsuming enterprise onto itself and requires expertise in many areas far a field from AI. However, computer games provide us with a source of cheap, reliable, and flexible technology for developing our own virtual environments for research.",

This classifier is described to find the decision hyperplanes to classify patterns of different classes in the feature space. An intelligent fuzzy controller is designed to improve the performance and efficiency of the proposed classifier by adapting three important parameters of PSO (inertia weight, cognitive parameter and social parameter). Three pattern recognition problems with different feature vector dimensions are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the introduced classifier: Iris data classification, Wine data classification and radar targets classification from backscattered signals. The experimental results show that the performance of the IPS-classifier is comparable to or better than the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifiers, which are two conventional classifiers.",

In recent years, a variety of efforts have been made to predict judicial decisions using different machine learning models, but no realistic performance comparison between them is available. In this paper, we conducted experiments comparing five well-known machine learning models: \u00c3-NN, logistic regression, bagging, random forests and SVM. Our experimental results show that the SVM model outperforms the other models over all the different settings, and the semantic information of the text in cases plays an important role in selecting features for the predicting models.",

Many real applications in GIS require functioning not only in data management and visualization, but also in analysis and decision-making. Confronted with an application of planning a new metro line in a city, a typical GIS is unable to accomplish the task in the absence of human experts or artificial intelligence technologies. Apart from being models for analyzing in different themes, some applications are also instances of problem solving in AI. Therefore, in order to strengthen its ability in automatic analysis, many theories and technologies from AI can be embedded in the GIS. In this paper, a state space is defined to formalize the metro line planning problem. By utilizing the defined state evaluation function, knowledge-based rules and strategies, a heuristic searching method is developed to optimize the solutions iteratively. Experiments are implemented to illuminate the validity of this AI-enhanced automatic analysis model of GIS.",

The aim is to show how program (based on evolutionary algorithms) can replace a man in the strategy game StarCraft: Brood War. Implementation used in our experiments use classic techniques of artificial intelligence environments, as well as unconventional techniques, such as evolutionary computation. An artificial player, proposed in this paper, is the combination of the decision tree and evolutionary algorithm SOMA. Whole code for experiments was written in the Java programming language. The proposed code provides a simple implementation of the artificial computer player in combination with slightly modified algorithm SOMA. This provides an opportunity for effective, coordinated movement of combat units around the combat landscape. Research reported here has shown potential benefit of evolutionary computation in the field of strategy games.",

            "paperAbstract": "The growing energy demand and environmental concerns have increased interests of academia, industry, and governments in the development of a smart electric power grid. While the existing power grid has served us well in the past, innovative technologies and solutions are needed to realize an intelligent smart grid providing affordable, reliable, sustainable, efficient, and secure supply of electricity. Among many efforts toward this goal, computational intelligence research offers key technical solutions to accomplish this goal. This special issue aims at presenting the state-of-the-art research with a focus on algorithms, architectures, applications needed for the development of a smart grid. Our goal is not only to introduce readers to the cutting-edge research results, but also to present critical visionary discussions and highlights for future computational intelligence research in smart grid. All contributions submitted to this special issue have been subject to a rigorous peer-review process, leading to the selection of four articles covering different aspects of computational intelligence in smart gr id research and development. In the opening feature article, Werbos presents a review of the evolution of the four generation of concepts of smart grid with a focus on contributions of the computational intelligence research to smart grid. The article shows that computational intelligence has played a critical role in four generations of smart grid. The first generation focused on the traditional concepts such as automated meters while the second generation focused on global control systems and stability issues. The new third and fourth generations of smart grid target an intelligent power grid operating in a sustainable global energy system. Critical components such as electric vehicles, renewable energy, storage, distributed intelligence and new computational intelligence tools providing key capabilities to handle the complexity and stochastic challenges of a smart grid have been discussed. This paper reviews the critical technical solutions needed for the smart grid development, and presents important opportunities and visionary discussions for the community for new fundamental research of computational intelligence for smart grid. In his paper, Venayagamoorthy outlines contributions of computational intelligence in developing dynamic, stochastic, and scalable technologies needed for sense-making, situational awareness, control, and optimization of a smart grid. The development of an intelligent power grid has been hampered by its complexity (e.g., spatial and temporal dependencies, nonlinearity, non-stationarity, uncertainties) far exceeding those in traditional power systems. The paper indicates that computational intelligence tools ranging from neural networks to swarm intelligence could play a critical role in many aspects of a smart grid, such as prediction of system states, stochastic power flow, and system optimization. In the third paper, Hu et al. presents a belief propagation (BP) based distribution system state estimator for smart grid development. Versed in computational intelligence, their approach overcomes the limitations of the traditional power system state estimations by using the BP approach to deal with sparse measurements. The presented probabilistic inference approach derives first and second order statistics of the state variables given prior distributions and real-time measurements. The article suggests that the BP solution can bridge the gap between the transmission state estimation and real-time feeder analysis leading to a potential usage in a smart micro-grid. The fourth paper by Felice and Yao presents a comparative study of shortterm load forecasting with neural network ensembles. Load forecasting has been widely recognized to be a critical component in management, scheduling, and dispatching operations in power systems. In an intelligent power grid, reliable and accurate forecasting of loads could provide vital information for system optimization and control, as well as decision-making in energy generation and dynamic pricing. In this article, a neural network ensemble has been investigated for hourly prediction of energy load based on data coming from seven office buildings located in Rome, Italy. We hope the four selected papers illustrate essential aspects of computational intelligence research in smart",

Which communication policies would be appropriate for the two cases? Perhaps, in the first case, agents would have to re-send questions regu- larly, while in the second, they would send out questions only once. Human attentional and memory capacities are both limited; hence, they are subject to a strate- gic tradeoff. The costs of producing and comprehend- ing linguistic communication, of attentional bottlenecks and decaying memory are relevant to a model, as is the structure of the network. One argument in support of co-adaptation could come from rational behavior in a dynamic group context. This means that cognitive pa- rameters such as memory decay and perceptual speed should influence communication and team success, and that cognitively plausible parameter choices in a model correspond to high performance during collaborative and communicative tasks, when other human performance parameters such as speed of communication are realis- tic. Abstract In social tasks, communication and task execution are often co-dependent, yet they represent a tradeoff. We present a cognitive model of an experimental task con- sisting of a collaborative and competitive game played by groups of human participants organized in a small- world graph. In an experiment involving teams of hu- mans playing a cooperative game, the effect of local communication policies on the efficiency and the per- formance of networked participants was observed. The model follows the ACT-R theory and provides a formal- ization of the decision-making processes and tradeoffs involved. A simulation of the hypothetical case of un- natural memory decay shows decreased performance and supports a prediction of the thesis that memory limita- tions have co-evolved with social structure. Keywords: Communication Networks; Belief Propaga- tion; Cognitive Modeling. Introduction Among our most fascinating abilities is communication and cooperation with others. To solve problems, we organize ourselves as teams and exchange information effortlessly. This achievement is the result of both in- nate and culturally acquired abilities. The combination of language-based communication, social interaction and the emergence of distributed human information systems is ubiquitous, but has seen relatively little empirical ex- ploration. Many of the implicit (subconscious) decisions taken in communication may be the result of innate mechanisms of cognition, specifically memory. Cognition is the result of adaptation to the environment according to the rational analysis of cognition (Oaksford & Chater, 1999). Therefore, mechanisms may have evolved that influence individual\u2019s interaction with a social network. Advances in cognitive modeling on the one hand, and in the description of structural properties of networks on the other allow us to correlate universal properties of social structures with the cognitive limitations of the individual. Performance or bounded rationality may be a rational optimization that supports an emergent group intelligence, or specifically the externalization of memory through a community of collaborators. Any computational cognitive model of team commu- nication needs to take into account the simple fact that humans have limited attentional and memory capaci- ties. To illustrate, consider a thought experiment. As- sume a network of communicating, cognitive agents that pass questions and answers about distributed informa- tion from node to node. Suppose two extremes: in the first, agents have unlimited attentional capacity, that is, their ability to process information in the environment is not constrained. However, agents have no memory to retain information that may be needed later on. In the Lab-based experiments, in which humans are net- worked artificially, playing an abstract game, represent a class of non-computational simulations that examine real-world phenomena at the group level. In this paper, we describe an experimental paradigm and previously presented data, a computational model and simulations that interpolate between the hypothetical cases of ei- ther perfect or absent human memory. The experiment looks beyond one-on-one dialogue to iterated communi- cation in social word-of-mouth networks. It involves a new cooperative foraging game, the Geo Game, in which medium-size and larger (20+) teams of players engage in information exchange, exploration of a game land- scape, and foraging for goods. The game elicits a cogni- tive tradeoff between a core task and a communication task, in which we expect the human cognitive appara- tus to maintain a purposeful balance. In the experiment that provided the basis for our model, we used differ- ent communication policies to explore both sides of this tradeoff. To quantify the success of communication, we use a combined individual and team task as a bench- mark. It measures the limits of individual and team performance in dynamically changing and time stressed environments. The cognitive model then explains per- formance data obtained with the experiment and is ul- timately used to show how team performance would be affected if basic memory parameters were different from their known, constrained values. We propose that indi-",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract Credit scoring models have been widely studied in the areas of statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). Many novel approaches such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), rough sets, or decision trees have been proposed to increase the accuracy of credit scoring models. Since an improvement in accuracy of a fraction of a percent might translate into significant savings, a more sophisticated model should be proposed for significantly improving the accuracy of the credit scoring models. In this paper, two-stage genetic programming (2SGP) is proposed to deal with the credit scoring problem by incorporating the advantages of the IF\u2013THEN rules and the discriminant function. On the basis of the numerical results, we can conclude that 2SGP can provide the better accuracy than other models.",

Human resource is one of the most strategic resources for a society and so forth for every type of organization, therefore offering a reasonable and intelligent service for employees of an organization is very essential. For this purpose, we have to pay a special attention collecting correct information about job applicants and employees of the organization. It would help the managers for optimal decision making in respect to selection process, recruitment, job rotation, training, payment system, job classification, evaluation and the other personnel operations. This research work is going to present a model for design and subsequently implement an expert system for: \u2022 Making preferences and selection of suitable applicants for a considered job with respect to job and organizational requirements (selection). \u2022 The selection of suitable jobs for applicants and correct job rotation with respect to organizational requirements and jobs classification (appointment). \u2022 Determination of the salary and benefit for the applicants based on their qualifications.",

Then he describes the new IEEE Transactions, which will publish archival quality original papers in all aspects of computational intelligence and AI related to all types of games. To name some examples, these include computer and video games, board games, card games, mathematical games, games that model economies or societies, serious games with educational and training applications, and games involving physical objects such as robot football and robotic car racing. Emphasis will also be placed on the use of these methods to improve performance in, and understanding of, the dynamics of games, as well as gaining insight into the properties of the methods as applied to games. It will also include using games as a platform for building intelligent embedded agents for real-world applications. The journal builds on a scientific community that has already been active in recent years with the development of new conference series such as the IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Games (CIG) and Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment (AIIDE), as well as special issues on games in journals such as the IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation. When setting up the journal, a decision was made to include both artificial intelligence (AI) and computational intelligence (CI) in the title. AI seeks to simulate intelligent behavior in any way that can be programmed effectively. Some see the field of AI as being all-inclusive, while others argue that there is nothing artificial about real intelligence as exhibited by higher mammals.",

The development of alternative plant protection product (hereinafter PPP) application techniques in recent decades has been based on various principles of sprayer operation. So far, several researchers have tried with partial success to find a compromise (a uniform standard) to ensure continuous PPP application to selected tree canopies in an orchard. Researchers have offered certain solutions for controlling dosage rates of PPP, based on special measurement systems and decision-making models to optimize the dosage rate of PPP. With sensing systems for electronic canopy characterization, which originally functioned on the basis of ultrasound waving and later on the principle of spectral reflection, characteristics of tree canopies in an orchard could be adequately estimated. However, attention must be paid to the fact that discrepancies in the original measurement systems were too large, owing to imprecise operation of various sensor components. Nevertheless it is necessary to underline that advanced spectral laser technology is a strong tool for developers of alternative PPP application techniques, and with it, tree canopy properties are sensed in real time. So it is no longer a major problem in the precise application to establish the tree canopy properties, but to control artificial intelligence actuation, which in the future will properly direct the air flow and the dosage rate of PPP per tree canopy in the orchard.",

Data mining can be used in various fields of real life and one of the areas where it is applied and presented in this paper is on education. The findings provided by the use of data mining in education can help in the increase of education quality. In this study we applied data mining techniques to find classification rules between student academic performance and master program that they wish to attend as well as to partition students into clusters according to their characteristics such as academic performance. The extraction of classification rules and clustering are carried out using C4.5 decision tree and k-means algorithms respectively. The results of both techniques suggest helping students to focus on the area they are interested in.",

            "paperAbstract": "In this paper we present a collaborative artificial intelligence (AI) module for a turn-based, multiplayer, environmental awareness game. The game is a version of the EnerCities serious game, modified in the context of a European-Union project to support sequential plays of an emphatic robotic tutor interacting with two human players in a social and pedagogical manner. For that purpose, we created an AI module capable of informing the game-playing and pedagogical decision-making of the robotic tutor. Specifically, the module includes an action planner capable of, together with a game simulator, perform forward-planning according to player preferences and current game values. Such predicted values are also used as an alert system to inform the other players of near consequences of current behaviors and advise alternative, sustainable courses of action in the game. The module also incorporates a social component that continuously models the game preferences of each player and automatically adjusts the tutor's strategy so to follow the group's \u201caction tendency\u201d. The proposed AI module is therefore used to inform about important aspects of the game state and also the human players actions. In this paper we overview the properties and complexity of this collaborative version of the game and detail the AI module and its components. We also report on the successes of using the proposed module for controlling the behavior of a robotic tutor in several experimental studies, including the interaction with children playing collaborative EnerCities.",

However, systems that deploy them have not been widely successful, in part due to the limitations of CIG frameworks in the adoption of inclusive and open technologies and the use of artificial intelligence techniques as tools to make their systems stronger and more adaptable. In this work, we propose a web-based CIG framework to tackle some of these challenges and facilitate the integration of CIG-based advice not only in the everyday activities of health care professionals, but also in the lives of whoever may need it.",

In addition, the prediction of probing rates is a key feature for security practitioners in their endeavors for making better operational decisions and for enhancing their defense strategy skills. In this work, we study different aspects of the traffic captured by a /20 network telescope. First, we perform an exploratory data analysis of the collected probing activities. The investigation includes probing rates at the port level, services interesting top network probers and the distribution of probing rates by geolocation. Second, we extract the network probers exploration patterns. We model these behaviors using transition graphs decorated with probabilities of switching from a port to another. Finally, we assess the capacity of Non-stationary Autoregressive and Vector Autoregressive models in predicting port probing rates as a first step towards using more robust models for better forecasting performance.",

Realizing that machines are devoid of understanding is likely to exacerbate the discomfort: the current generation of AI systems can accumulate knowledge but remains clueless about its meaning and incapable of explaining how it is used in making decisions. Machines can recognize familiar conditions and select appropriate responses but are incapable of responding adequately to novel situations. Humans encountering unfamiliar situations seek to understand them and optimize responses based on such understanding. All species can learn but understanding-based learning is a unique and definitive feature of human intelligence. The gnostron proposal strives to simulate brain mechanisms underlying human understanding. This paper summarizes some of the key ideas, aiming at facilitating further inquiries and accelerating progression from knowledge-based to understanding-based AI.",

When securing our networks we need good intelligence to direct our efforts and focus on the right spots. We need to find those spots and they can be found, with the right tools. Survival time is a method that provides possibilities to make decisions concerning information security risks based on true knowledge and hard facts, in a repeatable and scientific manner. This presented work aim to investigate the possibility to use survival time of an unprotected system as an intelligence source and measure the current survival time for a given unprotected system. By the deployment of a decoy, an unprotected system, data is captured and collected through port monitoring. Mainly focus lie on building a time curve presenting the estimated time for an unprotected public system to get detected on the Internet and the elapsed time hence the system gets attacked.",

However, a disadvantage with this approach is that the knowledge embedded in the neural network is opaque. In this paper, we show how to interpret neural network knowledge in symbolic form. We lay dawn required definitions for this treatment, formulate the interpretation algorithm, and formally verify its soundness. The main result is a formalized relationship between a neural network and a rule-based system. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the neural network generates rules of better performance than the decision tree approach in noisy conditions. >",

            "paperAbstract": "Enterprise executives understand that timely, accurate knowledge can mean improved business performance. Two technologies have been central in improving the quantitative and qualitative value of the knowledge available to decision makers: business intelligence and knowledge management. Business intelligence has applied the functionality, scalability, and reliability of modern database management systems to build ever-larger data warehouses, and to utilize data mining techniques to extract business advantage from the vast amount of available enterprise data. Knowledge management technologies, while less mature than business intelligence technologies, are now capable of combining today's content management systems and the Web with vastly improved searching and text mining capabilities to derive more value from the explosion of textual information. We believe that these systems will blend over time, borrowing techniques from each other and inspiring new approaches that can analyze data and text together, seamlessly. We call this blended technology BIKM. In this paper, we describe some of the current business problems that require analysis of both text and data, and some of the technical challenges posed by these problems. We describe a particular approach based on an OLAP (on-line analytical processing) model enhanced with text analysis, and describe two tools that we have developed to explore this approach--eClassifier performs text analysis, and Sapient integrates data and text through an OLAP-style interaction model. Finally, we discuss some new research that we are pursuing to enhance this approach.",

            "title": "Toward Human Level Machine Intelligence - Is It Achievable? The Need for a Paradigm Shift",
            "paperAbstract": "Officially, AI was born in 1956. Since then, very impressive progress has been made in many areas - but not in the realm of human level machine intelligence. During much of its early history, AI \"was rife \"with exaggerated expectations. A headline in an article published in the late forties of last century was headlined, \"Electric brain capable of translating foreign languages is being built\". Today, more than half a century later, we do have translation software, but nothing that can approach the quality of human translation. Clearly, achievement of human level machine intelligence is a challenge that is hard to meet. A prerequisite to achievement of human level machine intelligence is mechanization of these capabilities and, in particular, mechanization of natural language understanding. To make significant progress toward achievement of human level machine intelligence, a paradigm shift is needed. More specifically, what is needed is an addition to the armamentarium of AI of two methodologies: (a) a nontraditional methodology of computing with words (CW) or more generally, NL-Computation; and (b) a countertraditional methodology \"which involves a progression from computing with numbers to computing with words. The centerpiece of these methodologies is the concept of precisiation of meaning. Addition of these methodologies to AI would be an important step toward the achievement of human level machine intelligence and its applications in decision-making, pattern recognition, analysis of evidence, diagnosis, and assessment of causality. Such applications have a position of centrality in our infocentric society.",

            "paperAbstract": "As the information technology grows interests in the intrusion detection system (IDS), which detects unauthorized usage, misuse by a local user and modification of important data, have been raised. In the field of anomaly-based IDS several artificial intelligence techniques are used to model normal behavior. However, there is no perfect detection method so that most of IDSs can detect the limited types of intrusion and suffers from its false alarms. Combining multiple detectors can be a good solution for this problem of conventional anomaly detectors. This paper proposes a detection method that combines multiple detectors using a machine learning technique called decision tree. We use conventional measures for intrusion detection and modeling methods appropriate to each measure. System calls, resource usage and file access events are used to measure user\u2019s behavior and hidden Markov model, statistical method and rule-base method are used to model these measures which are combined with decision tree. Experimental results with real data clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method that has significantly low false-positive error rate against various types of intrusion.",

            "paperAbstract": "Modern artificial intelligence has been widely discussed to practice in automated financial asserts trading. Automated intraday trading means that the agent can react to the market conditions automatically, while simultaneously make the right decisions. Besides, the profits will be made within a day considering transaction cost charged by the brokerage company. In this paper, we introduce a multiobjective deep reinforcement learning approach for intraday financial signal representation and trading. We design the deep neural networks to automatically discover the dynamic market features, then a reinforcement learning method implemented by a special kind of recurrent neural network (LSTM) is applied to make continuous trading decisions. In terms of balancing the profit and risk, we implement a multi-objective structure which includes two objectives with different weights. We conduct experiments on stock index futures data, and our analysis and experiments not only offer insights into financial market features mining, but also provide a straightforward and reliable method to make profits, which sheds light on its wide application on automated financial trading.",

            "paperAbstract": "The paper discusses reasoning application for decision making in medical diagnosis. This is to reason on medical concepts that are viewed on two type ontologies; namely physical and mental. We highlighted in this position paper issues on fuzzy reasoning by aggregating two types of ontologies that are used to formalize a patient state: mental ontology reflecting the patient mental behavior due to certain disorder and physical ontology reflecting the observed physical behavior exhibited through disorder. Similarity matching is used to find the similarity between fuzzy set reflected to mental fuzzy ontology, and physical fuzzy ontology. The alignment is projected on medical ontology to rank attributes for decision making. We apply aggregate function for ranking attributes related to physical object. In the same time, we apply harmonic power average aggregate function fuzzy for ranking attributes related to mental objects. The alignment of these two aggregate function produce weighted ranking order fuzzy set for medical decision making for diagnosis. The paper highlights these issues as new challenges extending intelligence reasoning of VDS.",

Data mining can be used in various fields of real life and one of the areas where it is applied and presented in this paper is on education. The findings provided by the use of data mining in education can help in the increase of education quality. In this study we applied data mining techniques to find classification rules between student academic performance and master program that they wish to attend as well as to partition students into clusters according to their characteristics such as academic performance. The extraction of classification rules and clustering are carried out using C4.5 decision tree and k-means algorithms respectively. The results of both techniques suggest helping students to focus on the area they are interested in.",

            "paperAbstract": "In this paper, an artificial intelligence solution to diagnose faults before acquisition of submersible petroleum motor pump systems is presented. Proper fault identification is time consuming and demands highly trained human experts. The diagnosis system is intended to facilitate the work of the human component of this important process by replicating the decision of highly trained experts through a classifier. To perform the automatic diagnosis, firstly intermediate features are extracted as the vibration spectra. Subsequently, high level features are extracted and fed into a classifier that outputs the final diagnose. To validate our proposal and to select the best classifier (among K-Nearest-Neighbour, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree) for this problem, we performed a comparative study using real data acquired in tests accomplished before acquisition of submersible motor pumps. Our dataset comprises thousands of entries of accelerometer sensors (vertically distributed along the particular system components) data labelled by an human expert to one of the considered scenarios (normal pump, faulty sensor, faulty pump with rubbing, misalignment or unbalance). Results have showed that the evaluated classifiers have equivalent performance for the given problem, and that the standardization procedure can improve the performance of some classifiers. The performance of the classifiers is sufficient to facilitate the work performed by humans and consequently reduce the time spent in the pump fault diagnosis process.",

            "paperAbstract": "Reports in the recent literature abundantly indicate that for many people, in the general public and scientific community alike, advances in machine intelligence present a disturbing prospect. Realizing that machines are devoid of understanding is likely to exacerbate the discomfort: the current generation of AI systems can accumulate knowledge but remains clueless about its meaning and incapable of explaining how it is used in making decisions. Machines can recognize familiar conditions and select appropriate responses but are incapable of responding adequately to novel situations. Humans encountering unfamiliar situations seek to understand them and optimize responses based on such understanding. All species can learn but understanding-based learning is a unique and definitive feature of human intelligence. The gnostron proposal strives to simulate brain mechanisms underlying human understanding. This paper summarizes some of the key ideas, aiming at facilitating further inquiries and accelerating progression from knowledge-based to understanding-based AI.",

In real life, successful soccer teams require many qualities, such as basic ball control skills, the ability to carry out strategies, and teamwork. We believe that simulating such behaviors is a significant challenge for computer science, artificial intelligence, and robotics technologies. It is to promote the development of such technologies, and to help define a new standard problem for research, that we have developed Soccer Server. We demonstrate the potential of Soccer Server by reporting an experiment that uses the system to compare the performance of a neural network architecture and a decision tree algorithm at learning the selection of soccer play plans. Other researchers using Soccer Server to investigate the nature of cooperative behavior in a multiagent environment will have the chance to assess their progress at RoboCup-97, an internatio...",

Unlike the past, the performance of an enterprise now depends much on the performance and relationship of its customer\u2013suppliers in the value chain. Good customer\u2013supplier relationships are important for an organization to respond to dynamic and unpredictable changes. This paper describes a knowledge-based supplier selection and evaluation system, which is a case-based reasoning decision support system for outsourcing operations at Honeywell Consumer Products (Hong Kong) Limited in China. As a result, collaborative suppliers are identified quickly during the new product development process. By using the system, the cumulative performance of suppliers is constantly updated automatically according to past practice. This means that the knowledge of suppliers can be retained, categorized, retrieved and managed effectively.",

            "paperAbstract": "Question Answering (QA) is undoubtedly a growing field of current research in Artificial Intelligence. Question classification, a QA subtask, aims to associate a category to each question, typically representing the semantic class of its answer. This step is of major importance in the QA process, since it is the basis of several key decisions. For instance, classification helps reducing the number of possible answer candidates, as only answers matching the question category should be taken into account. This paper presents and evaluates a rule-based question classifier that partially founds its performance in the detection of the question headword and in its mapping into the target category through the use of WordNet. Moreover, we use the rule-based classifier as a features\u2019 provider of a machine learning-based question classifier. A detailed analysis of the rule-base contribution is presented. Despite using a very compact feature space, state of the art results are obtained.",

            "paperAbstract": "The nature of management accountants' responsibility is evolving from merely reporting aggregated historical value to also including organizational performance measurement and providing management with decision related information. Corporate information systems such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have provided management accountants with both expanded data storage power and enhanced computational power. With big data extracted from both internal and external data sources, management accountants now could utilize data analytics techniques to answer the questions including: what has happened (descriptive analytics), what will happen (predictive analytics), and what is the optimized solution (prescriptive analytics). However, research shows that the nature and scope of managerial accounting has barely changed and that management accountants employ mostly descriptive analytics, some predictive analytics, and a bare minimum of prescriptive analytics. This paper proposes a Managerial Accounting Data Analytics (MADA) framework based on the balanced scorecard theory in a business intelligence context. MADA provides management accountants the ability to utilize comprehensive business analytics to conduct performance measurement and provide decision related information. With MADA, three types of business analytics (descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive) are implemented into four corporate performance measurement perspectives (financial, customer, internal process, and learning and growth) in an enterprise system environment. Other related issues that affect the successful utilization of business analytics within a corporate-wide business intelligence (BI) system, such as data quality and data integrity, are also discussed. This paper contributes to the literature by discussing the impact of business analytics on managerial accounting from an enterprise systems and BI perspective and by providing the Managerial Accounting Data Analytics (MADA) framework that incorporates balanced scorecard methodology.",

            "paperAbstract": "There is a growing recognition that an incremental approach to software development is often more suitable and less risky than the traditional waterfall approach. Delivering software in an incremental fashion suggests better customer satisfaction and reduces many of the risks associated with delivering large software projects. In this paper, we consider the problem of deciding which requirements should be assigned to which release. The proposed hybrid approach called EVOLVE* improves existing methods for release planning by combining the strength of mathematical models with the subtleness of experts' knowledge and judgment. It makes use of different computationally intelligent techniques such as evolutionary computing and principles of multi-criteria decision aid. This is combined with appropriate involvement of human intelligence. EVOLVE* consists of three main phases called modeling, exploration, and consolidation. Different from former algorithms of the EVOLVE family, our new approach plans only two releases in advance, i.e., each requirement is assigned to one of the following three categories: \"next release\", \"next but one release\", \"not yet assigned\". EVOLVE* aims to achieve maximum stakeholder satisfaction. Our iterative procedure allows intelligent search of most promising solutions under the competing criteria of time, benefit and quality as described by the \"magic triangle\". The complete approach is illustrated by a case study example.",

Because this technology features the use of artificial intelligence to coordinate collaborative behavior in distributed systems, it supplies a powerful basis for proactive applications in complex organizations. Efficiently responding to large-scale disasters requires many complex tasks to be performed by multiple actors under extreme time and resource constraints. We expect that the application of agent technology can support more timely and enhanced data acquisition, information production, decision support, and action coordination. Applications of agent technology\u2014agentbased systems\u2014can be used to support many processes throughout the phases of the disaster management cycle from mitigation and preparation to actual response and recovery. Currently, we distinguish two major research areas: agentbased simulation systems, which allow the creation of realistic post-disaster environments, and agent-based decision support systems to support disaster managers on various levels. Agent-based simulation systems are generally used to model human and systems behavior during or after disaster events. By including up to millions of agents it is possible to analyze complex disaster scenarios and test various response strategies. Agents in this type of system do not provide active decision support, but\u2014 although calibration and validation of the behavioral models is difficult\u2014these systems may be used to better understand the dynamics of disasters and may also be included in computer-based training programs. Current research includes, among other areas, post-earthquake rescue simulation, evacuation planning, or spread of infectious diseases. During disaster response agent-based systems are envisioned to support emergency managers by helping to maintain common situational awareness and by aiding the planning and coordination of response activities. Agent technology may provide benefits to a number of important system requirements for future disaster management applications. Relevant agent characteristics include:",

            "paperAbstract": "In Dynamic Information Retrieval modeling we model dynamic systems which change or adapt over time or a sequence of events using a range of techniques from artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning. Many of the open problems in current IR research can be described as dynamic systems, for instance, session search or computational advertising. State of the art research provides solutions to these problems that are responsive to a changing environment, learn from past interactions and predict future utility. Advances in IR interface, personalization and ad display demand models that can react to users in real time and in an intelligent, contextual way. The objective of this half-day tutorial is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to Dynamic Information Retrieval Modeling. We motivate a conceptual model linking static, interactive and dynamic retrieval and use this to define dynamics within the context of IR. We then cover a number of algorithms and techniques from the artificial intelligence (AI) and online learning literature such as Markov Decision Processes (MDP), their partially observable variation (POMDP) and multi-armed bandits. Following this we describe how to identify dynamics in an IR problem and demonstrate how to model them using the described techniques. The remainder of the tutorial will then cover an array of state-of-the-art research on dynamic systems in IR and how they can be modeled using using dynamic IR. We use research on session search, multi-page search and online advertising as in-depth examples of such work. This tutorial is of relevance to IR practitioners and researchers, where we will present the merits of dynamic information retrieval modeling and introduce the relevant techniques. The content will be of particular interest to researchers working in the areas of statistical modeling, personalization and recommendation, and is also relevant to practitioners in Web search, online advertising and anyone who works with big data. After this tutorial, attendees will: Be able to identify the dynamics in an IR system; Be able to model these dynamics using techniques from AI and reinforcement learning; Have knowledge of the state-of-the-art research in dynamic information retrieval modeling.",

There are two important steps in an AID algorithm: traffic flow feature generation and incident decision making. In the past decade, the research on freeway AID algorithms has been focused on using artificial intelligence to optimize the decision making of AID algorithms. In this paper, the primary focus is on finding a new set of variables for the feature generation. The new variables, uncongested and congested regime shifts (URS and CRS), are generated by conducting coordinate transformation on loop-detected flow and occupancy measurements. A novel AID algorithm, the fundamental diagrams\u2013based automatic incident detection (FD AID) algorithm, is then developed by implementing the incident-related traffic flow knowledge using those variables. Preliminary results show superior performance of the FD algorithm compared with legacy algorithms.",

            "paperAbstract": "Decision support systems (DSSs) are playing an increasingly important role in the characterization of suspicious activities in an area of interest given their proved ability to turn vast amounts of raw data into actionable intelligence that is easy to understand by human operators. Although risk management is an integral component of the decision making process that directly contributes towards improved situational awareness and response assessment, an active end-to-end consideration of the underlying risk sources in the environment is still an important feature that most DSSs currently lack. Additionally, deciding on an appropriate course of action (COA) to mitigate emerging threats in the system is a challenging task even for domain experts given that (1) the number of potential responses to analyze could be overwhelmingly large; (2) seldom are those responses judged in terms of the risks associated with their enactment and (3) assessing the effectiveness of the potential responses in the real world is usually time-consuming and simulation-driven. In this paper, we formalize the adaptation of a recently proposed Risk Management Framework to account for behavioral intents associated with the objects of interest (OOIs) in the monitoring environment and their link to automatic response generation. The intent of the objects is inferred from high-level cognitive and behavioral knowledge in the form of anomalies. When an OOI has crossed a permissible risk threshold, we demonstrate how responses to that situation can be automatically elicited by the COA recommendation module of a risk-aware DSS. Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is used to judge a diverse set of plausible responses according to different operational objectives. We illustrate the application of the proposed framework in the context of maritime surveillance operations by triggering a corporate search for a missing vessel. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that risk features are synthesized from anomalies and integrated into a more comprehensive RMF engine for knowledge (response) elicitation.",

The trend in question relates to a marked increase in what might be called the Machine Intelligence Quotient (MIQ) of such products compared to what it was before 1990. Today, we have microwave ovens and washing machines that can figure out on their own what settings to use to perform their tasks optimally; cameras that come close to professional photographers in picture-taking ability; and many other products that manifest an impressive capability to reason, make intelligent decisions, and learn from experience",

To extract hidden predictive information from large volumes of data, data mining (DM) techniques are needed. Organizations are starting to realize the importance of data mining in their strategic planning and successful application of DM techniques can be an enormous payoff for the organizations. This paper discusses the requirements and challenges of DM, and describes major DM techniques such as statistics, artificial intelligence, decision tree approach, genetic algorithm, and visualization.",

            "paperAbstract": "Innovative control strategies are needed to cope with the increasing urban traffic chaos. In most cases, the currently used strategies are based on a central traffic-responsive control system which can be demanding to implement and maintain. Therefore, a functional and spatial decentralization is desired. For this purpose, distributed artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems have come out with a series of techniques which allow coordination and cooperation. However, in many cases these are reached by means of communication and centrally controlled coordination processes, giving little room for decentralized management. Consequently, there is a lack of decision-support tools at managerial level (traffic control centers) capable of dealing with decentralized policies of control and actually profiting from them. In the present work a coordination concept is used, which overcomes some disadvantages of the existing methods. This concept makes use of techniques of evolutionary game theory: intersections in an arterial are modeled as individually-motivated agents or players taking part in a dynamic process in which not only their own local goals but also a global one has to be taken into account. The role of the traffic manager is facilitated since s/he has to deal only with tactical ones, leaving the operational issues to the agents. Thus the system ultimately provides support for the traffic manager to decide on traffic control policies. Some application in traffic scenarios are discussed in order to evaluate the feasibility of transferring the responsibility of traffic signal coordination to agents. The results show different performances of the decentralized coordination process in different scenarios (e.g. the flow of vehicles is nearly equal in both opposing directions, one direction has a clearly higher flow, etc.). Therefore, the task of the manager is facilitate once s/he recognizes the scenario and acts accordingly.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract Game trees are a useful model of many kinds of decision-making situations, and have been the subject of considerable investigation by researchers in both artificial intelligence and decision analysis. Until recently it was almost universally believed that searching deeper on a game tree would in general improve the quality of a decision. However, recent theoretical investigations [8\u201310] by this author have demonstrated the existence of an infinite class of game trees for which searching deeper consistently degrades the quality of a decision. This paper extends the previous work in two ways. First, the existence of pathology is demonstrated in a real game (Pearl's Game) using a real evaluation function. This pathological behavior occurs despite the fact that the evaluation function function increases dramatically in accuracy toward the end of the game. Second, the similarities and differences between this game and a related nonpathological game are used as grounds for speculation on why pathology occurs in some games and not in others.",

Top-down symbolic methods and bottom-up sub-symbolic approaches are described. In recent years, computational intelligence, cognitive science and neuroscience have achieved a level of maturity that allows integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches in modeling the brain. Continuous adaptation and teaming is a key component of computationally intelligent devices, which is achieved using dynamic models of cognition and consciousness. Human cognition performs a granulation of the seemingly homogeneous temporal sequences of perceptual experiences into meaningful and comprehensible chunks of concepts and complex behavioral sehemas. They are accessed during action selection and conscious decision making as part of the intentional cognitive cycle. Implementations in computational and robotic environments are demonstrated.",

            "paperAbstract": "The paper concerns design of control systems for Demand Dispatch to obtain ancillary services to the power grid by harnessing inherent flexibility in many loads. The role of \u201clocal intelligence\u201d at the load has been advocated in prior work; randomized local controllers that manifest this intelligence are convenient for loads with a finite number of states. The present work introduces two new design techniques for these randomized controllers: (i) The Individual Perspective Design (IPD) is based on the solution to a one-dimensional family of Markov Decision Processes, whose objective function is formulated from the point of view of a single load. The family of dynamic programming equation appears complex, but it is shown that it is obtained through the solution of a single ordinary differential equation. (ii) The System Perspective Design (SPD) is motivated by a single objective of the grid operator: Passivity of any linearization of the aggregate input-output model. A solution is obtained that can again be computed through the solution of a single ordinary differential equation. Numerical results complement these theoretical results.",

The chronic diseases are responsible for increasingly growing health spending. Telemonitoring systems provide a way to monitor patients and their needs within the comfort of their own homes. In the first systems, the data were sent directly to the medical experts to be interpreted. With technological advancements, software and applications have been developed to process the data. In this paper, we will focus on e-Care platform that combines the semantic web and artificial intelligence, for telemonitoring. e-Care is based on generic ontologies to accommodate different conditions and types of sensors and data. A decision support is bases on an inference engine, this engine is used for following up the health of the patient and the detection of abnormal situations and react accordingly, by providing recommendations and informing his physician with alerts.",

General video game playing (GVGP) is a new branch of AI whose target is to design agents that are able to win in every unknown game environment by choosing wise decisions. This paper proposes a new search methodology based on enforced hill climbing for using in GVGP and we evaluate its performance on the benchmarks of the general video game AI competition (GVG-AI). Also a simple and efficient heuristic function for GVGP is proposed. The results show that EnHiC outperforms several well-known and successful methods in the GVG-AI competition.",

            "paperAbstract": "A great variety of complex real-life problems can be sufficiently solved by intelligent nature-inspired methods which can be considered part of artificial or computational intelligence. These newly introduced techniques have proven their important role on many successful implementations, mostly related to optimization problems. The basic reason for their success is that they imitate the way that real-life networks and other biological systems function and evolve in order to solve problems in different domains. Such systems can be found in the human brain (neurons), or can be observed in the natural world in the form of ant colonies, flocks of birds, as well as in other examples taken from the microcosm such as the human immune system. In this paper, we try to briefly present popular nature-inspired techniques, ant colony optimization and particle swarm optimization, and also to clarify the significance and appropriateness of nature-inspired intelligent approaches for solving complex financial optimization problems. A short discussion in included for a number of selected financial decision making applications, i.e. forecasting of financial distress, multi-stage portfolio optimization, credit scoring, investment decisions and capital investment planning.",

The trend in question relates to a marked increase in what might be called the Machine Intelligence Quotient (MIQ) of such products compared to what it was before 1990. Today, we have microwave ovens and washing machines that can figure out on their own what settings to use to perform their tasks optimally; cameras that come close to professional photographers in picture-taking ability; and many other products that manifest an impressive capability to reason, make intelligent decisions, and learn from experience",

To extract hidden predictive information from large volumes of data, data mining (DM) techniques are needed. Organizations are starting to realize the importance of data mining in their strategic planning and successful application of DM techniques can be an enormous payoff for the organizations. This paper discusses the requirements and challenges of DM, and describes major DM techniques such as statistics, artificial intelligence, decision tree approach, genetic algorithm, and visualization.",

In other words, the purpose of business intelligence is to provide actionable insight Business intelligence technologies include traditional data warehousing technologies such as reporting, ad-hoc querying, online analytical processing (OLAP). More advanced business intelligence tools - such as HP Openview DecisionCenter - also include data-mining, predictive analysis using rule-based simulations, Web services and advanced visualization capabilities. In this paper we describe a service-oriented architecture for business intelligence that makes possible a seamless integration of technologies into a coherent business intelligence environment, thus enabling simplified data delivery and low-latency analytics. We compare our service-oriented approach with traditional BI architectures, illustrate the advantages of the service oriented paradigm and share our experience and the lessons learned in architecting and implementing the framework.",

            "paperAbstract": "Reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs) has emerged as an advanced system for applying Enterprise Systems (ES) in manufacturing enterprises to dynamically adapt to the changing market. Although it has been recognized that human-machine interaction plays a significant role in configuration design, especially for reconfigurable machines tools (RMTs), for the core of RMS, there are no platforms available for the harmonious interaction between human and computer, mainly because of the limitation of traditional artificial intelligence frame. In this paper, we present a human-machine design methodology for the configuration of RMTs based on imaginal thinking, a thinking style described as forming and comparison of images, which is radically different from traditional logical and intuitive thinking. The knowledge and experience that are highly relevant to mechanical design and the related information in logical deduction are organized as high dimensional images. By imitating human imaginal thinking, computer employs Lie subgroup or submanifold and Quotient kinematics to generate all possible configurations in the form of images, while humans make judgments and complete the optimization process through the imaginal human-machine interface. Both human's decision-making ability based on knowledge and experience and computer's high-speed logical computation are exploited to a full extent. This novel design methodology has illustrated its effectiveness by an example concerning the design of a pipe-cutting RMT.",

            "paperAbstract": "Co-management of forest resources is a process of governance that enables all relevant stakeholders to participate in the decision-making processes. Illegal logging and forest degradation are currently increasing, and logging bans are ineffective in reducing forest degradation. At the same time interest in forest plantations and concern about poverty problems of neighboring people whose livelihoods depend on forest services and products continue to increase rapidly. Governments have identified the development of small forest plantations as an opportunity to provide wood supplies to forest industries and to reduce poverty. However, the development of small plantations is very slow due to an imbalance of power and suspicion between communities and large companies. This paper proposes a framework for linking social, economic and biophysical dynamics to create multi-agent simulations and explore scenarios of collaboration for plantations. Multi-agent simulation is a branch of artificial intelligence that offers a promising approach to dealing with multi-stakeholder management systems, such as common pool resources. It provides a framework which allows analysis of stakeholders' (or agents') interactions and decision making. Each stakeholder has explicit communication capacities, behaviors and rationales from which emerge specific actions. The purpose of this modeling is to create a common dynamic representation to facilitate negotiations for growing trees. A system of governance involving multi-stakeholders, especially local communities and wood based industries appearing to offer the most promising pathway to accelerating plantation development, local community poverty alleviation and forest landscape improvement.",

Top-down symbolic methods and bottom-up sub-symbolic approaches are described. In recent years, computational intelligence, cognitive science and neuroscience have achieved a level of maturity that allows integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches in modeling the brain. Continuous adaptation and teaming is a key component of computationally intelligent devices, which is achieved using dynamic models of cognition and consciousness. Human cognition performs a granulation of the seemingly homogeneous temporal sequences of perceptual experiences into meaningful and comprehensible chunks of concepts and complex behavioral sehemas. They are accessed during action selection and conscious decision making as part of the intentional cognitive cycle. Implementations in computational and robotic environments are demonstrated.",

A neural training model is proposed and tested here as a possible solution for dealing with natural fuzzification that appears between the intra-and inter-class distributions of scores computed during iris recognition tests. It is shown here that the use of proposed neural network support leads to an improvement in the artificial perception of the separation between the intra-and inter-class score distributions by moving them away from each other.",

            "paperAbstract": "Real-time response to construction cost estimation request is crucial for firms to survive and grow in the construction industry. However, no existing construction cost estimating system fulfills this need thus far. We describe a joint effort by the academia and the industrial partner on developing such a system. Advanced Web-based intelligence techniques are employed in the proposed system including WWW, neuro-fuzzy system, and data mining. The industrial partner is in charge of providing knowledge sources, including expert judgments and historical data, for conceptual cost estimation. A Web-based intelligent cost estimator (WICE) is resulted. The testing results show that the proposed system provides not only a globally accessible and promptly responding means for cost estimation, but also an effective and reliable tool for real-time decision-making.",

However, current techniques do not consider all the travel history and information of the vehicules. In this paper, we propose an automated negotiation mechanism with policies (along with specialized variants), which enables a distributed regulation of the right-of-way of the vehicles at an intersection, based on the travel context and the constraints of each vehicle. To account for the regulation needs, the technique employs a novel and generic negotiation model. Our simulations show that the proposed mechanism can increase the efficiency of the regulation.",

The current technology in communication and embedded systems allows products and production resources to play a more active role in the production process. This new active capacity will generate major changes in organizations and information systems (e.g., Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES)). New approaches are now required for modelling, testing and assessing the features made possible by the decisional and informational capabilities of these new active entities. One among the many possibilities is to use agents and holons, since agent and holon-based approaches assume interaction between intelligent entities to facilitate the emergence of a global behavior. This special issue thus focuses on the possible applications of distributed approaches for the design, evaluation and implementation of new control architectures for production systems. Both fundamental and applied research papers are presented.",

            "paperAbstract": "We present a hybrid routing protocol for both pure and hybrid ad hoc networks which uses the mechanisms of swarm intelligence to select next hops. Our protocol, Ad hoc Networking with Swarm Intelligence (ANSI), is a congestion-aware routing protocol, which, owing to the self-organizing mechanisms of swarm intelligence, is able to collect more information about the local network and make more effective routing decisions than traditional MANET protocols. Once routes are found, ANSI maintains routes along a path from source to destination effectively by using swarm intelligence techniques, and is able to gauge the slow deterioration of a link and restore a path along newer links as and when necessary. ANSI is thus more responsive to topological fluctuations. ANSI is designed to work over hybrid ad hoc networks: ad hoc networks which consist of both lower-capability, mobile wireless devices and higher-capability, wireless devices which may or may not be mobile. In addition, ANSI works with multiple interfaces and with both wired and wireless interfaces.Our simulation study compared ANSI with AODV on both hybrid and pure ad hoc network scenarios using both TCP and UDP data flows. The results show that ANSI is able to achieve better results (in terms of packet delivery, number of packets sent, end-to-end delay, and jitter) as compared to AODV in most simulation scenarios. In addition, ANSI achieves this performance with fewer route errors as compared to AODV. Lastly, ANSI is able to perform more consistently, considering the lower variation (measured as the width of the confidence intervals) of the observed values in the results of the experiments. We show that ANSI's performance is aided by both its superior handling of routing information and also its congestion awareness properties, though we see that congestion awareness in ANSI comes at a price.",

            "paperAbstract": "Reasoners compare problems to prior cases to draw conclusions about a problem and guide decision making. All Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) employs some methods for generalizing from cases to support indexing and relevance assessment and evidences two basic inference methods: constraining search by tracing a solution from a past case or evaluating a case by comparing it to past cases. Across domains and tasks, however, humans reason with cases in subtly different ways evidencing different mixes of and mechanisms for these components.In recent CBR research in Artificial Intelligence (AI), five paradigmatic approaches have emerged: statistically-oriented, model-based, planning/design-oriented, exemplar-based, and adversarial or precedent-based. The paradigms differ in the assumptions they make about domain models, the extent to which they support symbolic case comparison, and the kinds of inferences for which they employ cases.Reasoning with cases is important in legal practice of all kinds, and legal practice involves a wide variety of case-based tasks and methods. The paradigms' respective benefits and costs suggest different approaches for different legal tasks.CBR research and development in the field of AI and Law should be pursued vigoriously for several reasons. CBR can supplement rule-based expert systems, improving their abilities to reason about statutory predicates, solve problems efficiently, and explain their results. CBR can also contribute to the design of intelligent legal data retrieval systems and improve legal document assembly programs. Finally, in cognitive studies of various fields, it can model methods of transforming ill-structured problems into better structured ones through the use of case comparisons.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract This paper presents the use of first-order logic to improve upon currently employed engineering design knowledge management techniques. Specifically, this work uses description logic in unison with Horn logic, to not only guide the knowledge acquisition process but also to offer much needed support in decision making during the engineering design process in a distributed environment. The knowledge management methods introduced are highlighted by the ability to identify modeling knowledge inconsistencies through the recognition of model characteristic limitations, such as those imposed by model idealizations. The adopted implementation languages include the Semantic Web Rule Language, which enables Horn-like rules to be applied to an ontological knowledge base and the Semantic Web's native Web Ontology Language. As part of this work, an ontological tool, OPTEAM, was developed to capture key aspects of the design process through a set of design-related ontologies and to serve as an application platform for facilitating the engineering design process. The design, analysis, and optimization of a classical I-beam problem are presented as a test-bed case study to illustrate the capabilities of these ontologies in OPTEAM. A second, more extensive test-bed example based on an industry-supplied medical device design problem is also introduced. Results indicate that well-defined, networked relationships within an ontological knowledge base can ultimately lead to a refined design process, with guidance provided by the identification of infeasible solutions and the introduction of \u201cbest-case\u201d alternatives. These case studies also show how the application of first-order logic to engineering design improves the knowledge acquisition, knowledge management, and knowledge validation processes.",

            "paperAbstract": "The concept of wireless heterogeneous networks is based on the coexistence and interoperability of different types of radio access technologies in a unified wireless heterogeneous platform. A key process in the wireless heterogeneous networks is the initiation and execution of vertical handovers. Variety of mechanisms are proposed in the literature that are tailored to optimize the choice of radio access network in the process of vertical handover initialization. This paper proposes a novel mechanism for radio access technology (RAT) selection, the Hopfield neural network Rat selection Mechanism (HRM), that utilizes the Hopfield neural networks as a powerful decision making tool. The main advantage of the proposed mechanism lays in its ability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) reasoning and the use of multi-parameter decision by exploiting the options of IEEE 802.21 protocol. This approach allows improvements in terms of service retainability, decreased packet loss, jitter, etc. The performance of the novel mechanism is compared with two other types of RAT selection mechanisms (RSS based, and Multi-criteria policy based mechanism) throughout extensive simulations. The results clearly show the benefits of the proposed new mechanism and its justified usage in wireless heterogeneous systems.",

The main problem of heuristics is time required to find optimal solution. For this purpose, we propose to use parallel processing in the initial phase of heuristic methods to decrease computing time. Implemented technique models migration of individuals by adjusting initial population to required conditions. Proposed approach is simulating parallel processes that take place in human brain while solving tasks. In this case, human intelligence is working parallel on various aspects of the problem to compare them in the end before final decision. Proposed approach is simulating this parallelization of thinking threads in the process of optimization. Presented experimental tests have been carried out and discussed in terms of advantages and disadvantages.",

            "paperAbstract": "Decision making has become a strategic need for any business. Indeed, it is among the priorities of capital business. The establishment of decision information systems facilitates the data exploitation and analysis. We distinguish data warehouses as the core system of business intelligence to ensure the structuring and analysis of multidimensional data. Consequently, the design of data warehouses has become a major problem, leading to the development of appropriate approaches to implement data warehouses. In this paper, we propose an approach to design and to construct data warehouses based on a descriptive statistics technique for the analysis of multidimensional data in the Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The findings of this article appear in two main areas: (i) a conceptual model data warehouse, (ii) an algorithm for the determination of measures and dimensions. A case study is used to validate our proposal.",

To alleviate this problem, we proposed a Query By Example (QBE) approach powered by intelligent algorithms that discovers database queries from a few tuple examples provided by the user. We investigated the effectiveness of three algorithms, namely, Greedy Search, Genetic Programming, and CART decision trees in discovering queries in two distinct databases. To the best of our knowledge, no other research has focused on the comparative analysis of such algorithms in the context of QBE. Our results show that CART decision trees were capable of discovering the most accurate queries. However, CART tends to produce long queries, which may hinder user interpretation. Finally, we suggest that the use of Interactive Evolutionary Computational Intelligence may improve the quality of queries discovered by Genetic Programming and may naturally incorporate diverse user preferences in the discovery process.",

Security policies of information systems and networks are designed for maintaining the integrity of both the confidentiality and availability of the data for their trusted users. However, a number of malicious users analyze the vulnerabilities of these systems in order to gain unauthorized access or to compromise the quality of service. For this reason, Intrusion Detection Systems have been designed in order to monitor the system and trigger alerts whenever they found a suspicious event.Optimal Intrusion Detection Systems are those that achieve a high attack detection rate together with a small number of false alarms. However, cyber attacks present many different characteristics which make them hard to be properly identified by simple statistical methods. According to this fact, Data Mining techniques, and especially those based in Computational Intelligence, have been used for implementing robust and accuracy Intrusion Detection Systems.In this paper, we consider the use of Genetic Fuzzy Systems within a pairwise learning framework for the development of such a system. The advantages of using this approach are twofold: first, the use of fuzzy sets, and especially linguistic labels, enables a smoother borderline between the concepts, and allows a higher interpretability of the rule set. Second, the divide-and-conquer learning scheme, in which we contrast all possible pair of classes with aims, improves the precision for the rare attack events, as it obtains a better separability between a \"normal activity\" and the different attack types.The goodness of our methodology is supported by means of a complete experimental study, in which we contrast the quality of our results versus the state-of-the-art of Genetic Fuzzy Systems for intrusion detection and the C4.5 decision tree.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract The technical and social systems of the present day are ever more complex and complicated objects. Their models are characterized by large numbers of state and control variables, time delays, and different time constants. Also they show constraints in their information infrastructure and risk sensitivity aspects. Such systems are called large \u2013scale complex systems (LSS). Hierarchical approach has been for several decades one of the most utilized methodologies for controlling large-scale systems. When human intervention is necessary decision support systems (DSS) can represent a solution. A DSS is an adaptive and evolving information system meant to implement several of the functions of a human support team that would otherwise be needed to help the decision-maker to overcome his/her limits and constraints he/she may face when approaching decision problems that count in the organization. This paper aims at reviewing several aspects concerning LSS control and the utilization and technology of DSS. Particular emphasis is put on real-time DSS and multiparticipant (group) DSS. Several advanced solutions such as mixed knowledge systems, that combine numerical methods with AI-based tools, and the prospects of using Ambient Intelligence concepts in DSS construction are described.",

            "paperAbstract": "Few automated legal reasoning systems have been developed in domains of law in which a judicial decision maker has extensive discretion in the exercise of his or her powers. Discretionary domains challenge existing artificial intelligence paradigms because models of judicial reasoning are difficult, if not impossible to specify. We argue that judicial discretion adds to the characterisation of law as open textured in a way which has not been addressed by artificial intelligence and law researchers in depth. We demonstrate that systems for reasoning with this form of open texture can be built by integrating rule sets with neural networks trained with data collected from standard past cases. The obstacles to this approach include difficulties in generating explanations once conclusions have been inferred, difficulties associated with the collection of sufficient data from past cases and difficulties associated with integrating two vastly different paradigms. A knowledge representation scheme based on the structure of arguments proposed by Toulmin has been used to overcome these obstacles. The system, known as Split Up, predicts judicial decisions in property proceedings within family law in Australia. Predictions from the system have been compared to those from a group of lawyers with favourable results.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract This paper presents the use of first-order logic to improve upon currently employed engineering design knowledge management techniques. Specifically, this work uses description logic in unison with Horn logic, to not only guide the knowledge acquisition process but also to offer much needed support in decision making during the engineering design process in a distributed environment. The knowledge management methods introduced are highlighted by the ability to identify modeling knowledge inconsistencies through the recognition of model characteristic limitations, such as those imposed by model idealizations. The adopted implementation languages include the Semantic Web Rule Language, which enables Horn-like rules to be applied to an ontological knowledge base and the Semantic Web's native Web Ontology Language. As part of this work, an ontological tool, OPTEAM, was developed to capture key aspects of the design process through a set of design-related ontologies and to serve as an application platform for facilitating the engineering design process. The design, analysis, and optimization of a classical I-beam problem are presented as a test-bed case study to illustrate the capabilities of these ontologies in OPTEAM. A second, more extensive test-bed example based on an industry-supplied medical device design problem is also introduced. Results indicate that well-defined, networked relationships within an ontological knowledge base can ultimately lead to a refined design process, with guidance provided by the identification of infeasible solutions and the introduction of \u201cbest-case\u201d alternatives. These case studies also show how the application of first-order logic to engineering design improves the knowledge acquisition, knowledge management, and knowledge validation processes.",

Proactive care for Dementia is an important challenge that should be researched. Using Ambient Intelligence (AmI) solutions, different data modalities can be collected from home settings. Suggested solutions are concentrating on providing behaviour monitoring or telemonitoring solutions that are apt to support and help the clinicians' and carers' decision making in addition to helping family members to receive assurance about their relatives. We are using Hidden Markov Models in order to build a behavioural model based on raw sensor data. Although binary simple sensors are used, the resulting model can detect abnormalities, sudden and gradual, in elderly people's behaviour, which may be considered an indicator of dementia. The role of the suggested system is to raise an alarm whenever a behavioural change is detected and to leave decision making to the carer.",

The integration of electro-mechanical systems with hard- and software enables systems that adapt to changing operation conditions and externally defined objective functions. To gain superior system performance from this ability, sophisticated decision making processes are required. Planning is an ideal method to integrate long-term considerations beyond the time horizon of classical controlled systems into the decision making process. Unfortunately, planning employs discrete models, while mechatronic systems or controlled systems in general emphasize the time continuous behavior of processes. As a result, deviations of the actual behavior during the execution from the planned behavior plan cannot be entirely avoided. We introduce a hybrid planning architecture, which combines planning and learning from artificial intelligence with simulation techniques to optimize the general system behavior. The presented approach is able to handle the inevitable deviations during plan execution, and thus maintains feasibility and quality of the created plans.",

            "paperAbstract": "To maintain the reliability of material transport systems, monitoring of the entire system is required to optimize maintenance and operational control strategies. Traditional monitoring mainly focuses on individual subsystems and components. Due to the high distribution and system complexity, the monitoring and control of large-scale material transport systems need to be carried out in intelligent ways with integrated information. Agent technology, as an artificial intelligence methodology to handle the complexity of distributed systems, has been introduced in the field of continuous material conveying. This paper presents a multi-agent system (MAS) for the intelligent monitoring in large-scale continuous material transport. Under an agent-based architecture, annalistic and diagnostic entities and operational decision-making are carried out by the agents that monitor individual system parts and components. These agents are integrated together to form cooperative communities to achieve the goals of individual agents and, especially, of the monitoring system as a whole. This paper discusses the architecture, functions, knowledge organization and agent communication of the MAS. A prototype of the agent-based intelligent monitoring has been built in laboratory environment. The implementation of the agent system has showed successful single agent functioning and the cooperation and the coordination between multiple agents. The application of agent technology reduces the complexity of the large-scale monitoring system by means of integrating individual monitoring systems.",

            "paperAbstract": "Algorithmically generating music using specialized algorithms is a growing focus in computer science. The success of these specialized algorithms in generating music, however, depends heavily on the fitness function that is used to score the generated music and equally as important is how the fitness function is designed. Artificial intelligence in the computational composition can use certain feature set values derived from melodic analysis to serve as criteria for these fitness functions. This study explores two methods in defining the key features to be used as fitness criteria for algorithmic music generation of music that can be considered under a mix of two musical genres or hybrid-genre music. The jSymbolic tool was used to extract 101 features from musical pieces that fall under two genres. This was then reduced to a smaller feature set for use as fitness criteria. Two methods for feature reduction was explored; a decision-tree-based technique and a high-correlation-filtering technique. The study was able to confirm that each technique can be used to compose hybrid-genre music with 86% success-rate as confirmed by SVM when validated under the same dataset used in the study. This study does not claim to consistently result in a high success rate for all existing datasets.",

CDSSs built so far mainly deal with explicit medical knowledge, typically encoded into a knowledge base. The rationale is that medical personal knowledge may be updated or time constraints limit physicians\u2019 ability to properly manage that knowledge. However, inter-user variability due to subjectivity in feature evaluation has been typically ignored when building clinical decision support systems. In some cases implicit medical knowledge can be important to share, especially for novices\u2019 education. In this work we present an approach for building CDSSs facing this problem through different artificial intelligence techniques: a machine learning approach for a critiquing module and a case based reasoning approach for a consulting module. The purpose is to build a system accounting for the specific skill an expertise of the user, providing new or enough information to take",

The central issue is model representation which involves knowledge representation and knowledge management within a database environment. The model abstraction structure is introduced as a vehicle for model representation which supports both heuristic and deterministic inferencing as well as the conceptual/external schema notion familiar to database management. The model abstraction is seen as a special instance of the frame construct in artificial intelligence. Model management systems are characterized as frame-systems and a database implementation of this approach is described.",

            "paperAbstract": "In many real-world group decision making problems, the set of alternatives is a Cartesian product of finite value domains for each of a given set of variables (or issues). Dealing with such domains leads to the following well-known dilemma: either ask the voters to vote separately on each issue, which may lead to the so-called multiple election paradoxes as soon as voters' preferences are not separable; or allow voters to express their full preferences on the set of all combinations of values, which is practically impossible as soon as the number of issues and/or the size of the domains are more than a few units. We try to reconciliate both views and find a middle way, by relaxing the extremely demanding separability restriction into this much more reasonable one: there exists a linear order on the set of issues such that for each voter, every issue is preferentially independent of given . This leads us to define a family of sequential voting rules, defined as the sequential composition of local voting rules. These rules relate to the setting of conditional preference networks (CP-nets) recently developed in the Artificial Intelligence literature. Lastly, we study in detail how these sequential rules inherit, or do not inherit, the properties of their local components.",

            "title": "Adaptive business intelligence based on evolution strategies: some application examples of self-adaptive software",
            "paperAbstract": "Self-adaptive software is one of the key discoveries in the field of evolutionary computation, originally invented in the framework of so-called Evolution Strategies in Germany. Self-adaptivity enables the algorithm to dynamically adapt to the problem characteristics and even to cope with changing environmental conditions - as they occur in unforeseeable ways in many real-world business applications.In evolution strategies, self-adaptability is generated by means of an evolutionary search process that operates on the solutions generated by the method as well as on the evolution strategy's parameters, i.e., the algorithm itself. By focusing on a basic algorithmic variant of evolution strategies, the fundamental idea of self-adaptation is outlined in this paper.Applications of evolution strategies for NuTech's clients include the whole range of business tasks, including R&D, technical design, control, production, quality control, logistics, and management decision support. While such examples can of course not be disclosed, we illustrate the capabilities of evolution strategies by giving some simpler application examples to problems occurring in traffic control and engineering.",

            "title": "On the many ways software engineering can benefit from knowledge engineering",
            "paperAbstract": "Software Engineering is not only a technical discipline of its own. It is also a problem domain where technologies coming from other disciplines are relevant and can play an important role. One important example is knowledge engineering, a term that I use in the broad sense to encompass artificial intelligence, computational intelligence, knowledge bases, data mining, and machine learning. I see a number of typical software development issues that can benefit from these disciplines and, for the sake of clarifying the discussion, I have divided them into four categories: (1) Planning, monitoring, and quality control of projects, (2) The quality and process improvement of software organizations, (3) Decision making support, (4) Automation.First, the planning, monitoring, and quality control of software development is typically based, unless it is entirely ad-hoc, on past project data and/or expert opinion. As discussed below, several techniques coming from machine learning, computational intelligence, and knowledge-based systems have shown to be useful in this context. Second, software organizations are inherently learning organizations, that need to improve, based on experience and project feedback, the way they develop software in changing and volatile environments. Large amounts of data, numerous documents, and other forms of information are typically gathered on projects. The question then becomes how to enable the intelligent storage and use of such information in future projects. Third, during the course of a project, software engineers and managers have to face important, complex decisions. They need decision models to support them, especially when project pressure is intense. Techniques originally developed for building risk models based on expert elicitation or optimization heuristics can play a key role in such a context. The last category of applications concerns automation. Many automation problems, such as test data generation, can be formulated as constraint solving problems. A number of metaheuristic algorithms can be adapted for that purpose and have shown to be practically usable and flexible to adjust to numerous situations.This paper discusses all the points above, identify open issues and future research directions, and provide some carefully selected, key pointers for further reading.",

            "paperAbstract": "The idea of machines having emotions sounds like science fiction, however, few decades ago the idea of machines with intelligence seemed also like fiction, but today we are developing intelligent machines with successful applications. We have always overlooked the emotional factors during machine learning and decision making; however, it is quite conceivable to artificially model certain emotions in machine learning. This paper presents an emotional neural network (EmNN) that is based on the emotional back propagation (EmBP) learning algorithm. The EmNN has emotional weights and two emotional parameters; anxiety and confidence, which are updated during learning. The performances of the EmNN and a conventional BP-based neural network, using two topologies for each network, will be compared when applied to a blood cell type identification problem. Experimental results show that the additional emotional parameters and weights improved the identification rate as well as the classification time.",

This requires predicting the wind and solar resource on those timescales. Accurate prediction of these meteorological variables is a big data problem that requires a multitude of disparate data, multiple models that are each applicable to a specific time frame, and application of computational intelligence techniques to successfully blend all of the model and observational information in real-time and deliver it to the decision-makers at utilities and grid operators. Considering that the capacity of renewable energy continues to grow an additional challenge includes selecting and archiving data for continuous retraining of machine learning algorithms.",

Simon and other top Management Science/Operations Research (MS/OR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers, suggested that an integration of the two disciplines would improve the design of decision making support tools in organizations. The suggested integrated system has been called an intelligent decision-making support system (i-DMSS). In this paper, we use an existing conceptual framework posed to assess the capabilities and limitations of the i-DMSS concept, and through a conceptual meta-analysis research of the Decision Support System (DSS) and MS/OR literature from 1980 to 2004, we develop a strategic assessment of the initial proposal. Such an analysis reveals support gaps that suggest for further development of the initial i-DMSS concept. We offer recommendations for making the indicated improvements in I DMSS design, development, and application.",

The new millennium, however, has brought substantial progress in the field of theoretically optimal and practically feasible algorithms for prediction, search, inductive inference based on Occam's razor, problem solving, decision making, and reinforcement learning in environments of a very general type. Since inductive inference is at the heart of all inductive sciences, some of the results are relevant not only for AI and computer science but also for physics, provoking nontraditional predictions based on Zuse's thesis of the computer-generated universe.",

This domain has the specific characteristic that the key parameters of interest (pollutant concentration criteria) have multiple temporal (and spatial) scales. The present paper applies ANNs for the operational forecasting of the 8-hour running average for Ozone, 24 hours in advance, for two locations in Athens, Greece. Results verify the ability of the methods to analyze and model this knowledge domain and to forecast the levels of key parameters that provide direct input to the environmental decision making process.",

A social welfare function is developed to capture both fairness and efficiency objectives at the same time. Then, assuming a common altruistic goal for all network users, we propose a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) model for finding the optimal network bandwidth allocation that leads to social welfare maximization. We show that the resulting optimal policy for the proposed model outperforms TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC) protocol in terms of total utility and fairness.",

            "paperAbstract": "Eugenic selection of embryos is now possible by employing in vitro fertilization (IVF) and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). While PGD is currently being employed for the purposes of detecting chromosomal abnormalities or inherited genetic abnormalities, it could in principle be used to test any genetic trait such as hair colour or eye colour. Genetic research is rapidly progressing into the genetic basis of complex traits like intelligence and a gene has been identified for criminal behaviour in one family. Once the decision to have IVF is made, PGD has few 'costs' to couples, and people would be more inclined to use it to select less serious medical traits, such as a lower risk of developing Alzheimer Disease, or even for non-medical traits. PGD has already been used to select embryos of a desired gender in the absence of any history of sex-linked genetic disease. I will argue that: (1) some non-disease genes affect the likelihood of us leading the best life; (2) we have a reason to use information which is available about such genes in our reproductive decision-making; (3) couples should select embryos or fetuses which are most likely to have the best life, based on available genetic information, including information about non-disease genes. I will also argue that we should allow selection for non-disease genes even if this maintains or increases social inequality. I will focus on genes for intelligence and sex selection. I will defend a principle which I call Procreative Beneficence: couples (or single reproducers) should select the child, of the possible children they could have, who is expected to have the best life, or at least as good a life as the others, based on the relevant, available information.",

            "paperAbstract": "The importance of the maintenance function has increased because of its role in keeping and improving system availability and safety, as well as product quality. To support this role, the development of the communication and information technologies has allowed the emergence of the concept of e-maintenance. Within the era of e-manufacturing and e-business, e-maintenance provides the opportunity for a new maintenance generation. As we will discuss later in this paper, e-maintenance integrates existing telemaintenance principles, with Web services and modern e-collaboration principles. Collaboration allows to share and exchange not only information but also knowledge and (e)-intelligence. By means of a collaborative environment, pertinent knowledge and intelligence become available and usable at the right place and time, in order to facilitate reaching the best maintenance decisions. This paper outlines the basic ideas within the e-maintenance concept and then provides an overview of the current research and challenges in this emerging field. An underlying objective is to identify the industrial/academic actors involved in the technological, organizational or management issues related to the development of e-maintenance. Today, this heterogeneous community has to be federated in order to bring up e-maintenance as a new scientific discipline.",

The model builds on the argument that more accurate expectations about the firm-specific value of resources is, other than luck, the only way for firms to obtain the specific resources required for competitive advantage. We address the more specific question of what types of information firms should gather to accomplish this goal. The model generates a series of testable hypotheses about how a firm's optimal mix of different types of information is affected by a number of factors, including the level of uncertainty about the value of the resource being acquired; the rarity, imitability, and nonsubstitutability of that resource; the level of inscrutability of firms' pre-existing stocks of resources; and firms' information-gathering and information-processing capacities.",

Additionally, business intelligence (BI) applications have been installed to support management in measuring the company\u2019s performance and deriving appropriate decisions. BI and BPA initiatives are usually organized as separate IS projects that are not properly coordinated, leading in turn to an unsatisfactory alignment of strategic management and operational business process execution. The proposed article is to depict how new trends in the IS area can lead to a convergence of BPA and BI and therefore deliver appropriate support for an integrated corporate performance management (CPM). The utilization of IS in an integrated CPM solution is illustrated by an example from the telecommunications sector.",

            "paperAbstract": "Case-based reasoning (CBR) is widely used in data mining for managerial applications because it often shows significant promise for improving the effectiveness of complex and unstructured decision making. There are, however, some limitations in designing appropriate case indexing and retrieval mechanisms including feature selection and feature weighting. Some of the prior studies pointed out that finding the optimal k parameter for the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) is also one of the most important factors for designing an effective CBR system. Nonetheless, there have been few attempts to optimize the number of neighbors, especially using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. This study proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) approach to optimize the number of neighbors to combine. In this study, we apply this novel model to two real-world cases involving stock market and online purchase prediction problems. Experimental results show that a GA-optimized k-NN approach may outperform traditional k-NN. In addition, these results also show that our proposed method is as good as or sometime better than other AI techniques in performance-comparison.",

The system was constructed in order to provide cost-effective approach of computer assisted exercises and it is an integrated, interactive, many-sided land, analysis and training support model based on particular components equipped with combat, logistics, engineering, electronic warfare and intelligence functions. The idea and model of command and control process applied for the decision automata at the tactical level are presented. The automata executes the two main processes: decision planning process and direct combat control. The decision planning process relating to the automata contains three stages: the identification of a decision situation, the generation of decision variants (course of actions) the variants evaluation and nomination the best variant of these, which satisfy the proposed criteria. The particular approach to identification of decision situation and variants of action are presented. The procedure of variants generation based on some kind of pre-simulation process contains the evaluation module, which allows us the best choice of action plan according to specified criteria. The direct combat control process contains such phases, like command, reporting and reaction to fault situations. Some results of the simulation process including the decisions made by automata is considered. The calibration process on the basis of battle scenarios is described and presented",

Although engineers\u2019 strategy is markedly different, design alternatives play a role that is as important, if not more important, than for artchitects (Akin, 2009). Where designers typically consider a very small number of alternatives in their work, this can be explained by cognitive limits, opening the door for computational support of design exploration. In particular, Woodbury and Burrow (2006) argued that exploration is a compelling model for designer action and that designers benefit from tools that amplify their abilities to represent goals and problems spaces, and to search for designs. Generative and evolutionary methods have proven to be strong catalysts for design exploration, and design optimization has served as a means to assist in this exploration. Recently there is a marked move toward using optimization to aid exploration. Optimization is rarely intended to yield an optimal solution per se, instead assisting in gaining insight in the solution space, thereby reducing the size of the solution space for exploration, possibly focusing attention toward the Pareto boundary. Even at the Pareto boundary, there are a large number of solutions worthy of further exploration. Exploration and optimization together lead to a better understanding of the complexities of design issues and help designers in their decision-making process, especially with multiple-objectives problems, which is a nature of many design problems. As such, the focus of attention in generative and evolutionary design is shifting from the techniques themselves, and their direct application, to the way we are using these techniques to assist and improve the design and engineering process. We might frame generative and evolutionary design from the point of view of a \u201cconversation\u201d in the sense of Donald Sch\u00f6n (1983); this is nothing uncommon for generative design, though it is for optimization. This type of conversation is between the designer (or design team) and the computer, and is digitally enhanced. As such, the aim is less on optimization per se and more on exploration: the results from optimization are about changing one\u2019s way of thinking more than choosing a single design and then realizing it. We can then ask the question of how these types of conversation can unfold. How do they start and where do they end? What to do with thousands of similar solutions? The 11 papers in this Special Issue all address generative and evolutionary design exploration and contribute to the discussion of the interaction between design exploration and evolutionary design optimization. Julian Eichhoff and Dieter Roller start off with \u201cA Survey on Automating Configuration and Parameterization in Evolutionary Design Exploration.\u201d Focusing specifically on engineering design, they comprehensively review evolutionary design optimization approaches based on genetic algorithms (and genetic programming) addressing different design phases. Reformulating design problems as multiple-objective design optimization problems commonly reduces to parameterization, defining constants, and configuration, defining design variables, objective functions, and constraint functions. Methods from the fields of machine learning and natural language processing are reviewed to support these parameterization and configuration processes. Herm Hofmeyer and Juan Manuel Davila Delgado, in \u201cCoevolutionary and Genetic Algorithm Based Building Spatial and Structural Design,\u201d compare the use of a genetic algorithm with a coevolutionary method to collaboratively develop and optimize building spatial and structural designs. The genetic algorithm uses a finite element analysis method for evaluation of design alternatives. The coevolutionary method applies deterministic procedures to cyclically evaluate and improve the structural design via a finite element method and topology optimization, and adjust the spatial design according to the improved structural design and the initial spatial requirements. Both methods provide optimized building designs; however, the coevolutionary method yields Reprint requests to: Rudi Stouffs, Department of Building Technology, Faculty of Architecture, Delft University of Technology Postbus 5043, 2600 GA Delft, The Netherlands E-mail: r.m.f.stouffs@tudelft.nl Artificial Intelligence for Engineering Design, Analysis and Manufacturing (2015), 29, 329\u2013331. # Cambridge University Press 2015 0890-0604/15 doi:10.1017/S0890060415000360",

Most current approaches to controller design rely solely on engineering knowledge. Utilizing technologies from computational intelligence is not yet common practice. In this work we evaluate how simple controllers can automatically be extracted from optimal control strategies computed by Dynamic Programming. We compare artificial neural network and decision tree based controllers in terms of performance (fuel consumption), stability, robustness, and interpretability, and we investigate the dependency on specific drive cycles used for generating optimal control. Our findings indicate that automatically derived controllers can result in a performance 1\u20132% below optimal fuel economy, but we observe a large variety in performance and in the controller structure for different drive cycles, thus, underlining the relevance of the correct choice of the drive cycles used for controller development. We also outline the impact of typical learning related issues like overfitting on the practical development process.",

            "paperAbstract": "ABC analysis is an inventory management technique used to classify inventory items into three predefined and ordered categories A, B and C: Category A contains items with the highest impact for the company, while the category C contains items with the lowest impact. The aim of this classification technique is to keep related inventory costs under control. According to the ABC analysis, the classification of items into categories is based on their weighted scores. The score of each item is the result of an aggregation function that combines the item evaluations on the different criteria and the criteria weights. In ABC literature many classification models - issued from different fields such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Mathematical Programming (MP) and Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) - are proposed to infer the criteria weights. This paper proposes two classification models based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) to infer the criteria weights. The two classifications of items obtained by these models optimize respectively the two following objective functions: The Total Relevant Cost (TRC to be minimized) and the Inventory Turnover Ratio (ITR to be maximized). To estimate the performance of the proposed classification models, a benchmark data set of 47 items consumed in a Hospital Respiratory Therapy Unit (HRTU) is used.",

            "paperAbstract": "In many decision situations, it is inevitable to deal with both quantitative and qualitative information under uncertainty. Evidence-based reasoning within a multiple criteria decision analysis framework provides an alternative way of handling such information systematically and consistently. In this paper, the evidential reasoning (ER) approach is introduced, which is based on a recursive ER algorithm that, in essence, constitutes a nonlinear information aggregation process. To facilitate the application of the ER approach and as an indispensable part of its development, the nonlinear features of the ER information aggregation process need to be thoroughly investigated and properly understood. This forms the theme of this paper where the nonlinear features are explored by examining typical reasoning patterns in aggregating harmonic, quasi-harmonic, and contradictory decision information. This analytical investigation provides insights into the recursive nature of the ER approach as well as valuable experience that could be useful to other researchers and practitioners interested in developing and applying operation research/artificial intelligence (OR/AI)-based approaches for decision analysis under uncertainty. The analytical study is complemented by the numerical studies of two application examples. The analysis of a quality assessment problem for motor engines is aimed to show the step-by-step process of implementing the ER approach and to illustrate its nonlinear features in a real-life decision situation. The study of a more complex assessment problem in ship design is intended to demonstrate the potential of the ER approach and its supporting software for dealing with general decision problems.",

Given the shortcomings of traditional scheduling algorithm in Intelligent Manufacturing, the architecture of multi-agent-based Intelligent Manufacturing System is put forward, which represents the basic processing entity. The architecture is based on the methodology of multi-agent systems (MAS) in distributed artificial intelligence (DAI). The multi-agent system has some common characteristics, such as distribution, autonomy, interaction and openness, which are helpful to transform the traditional architecture into a distributed and cooperative architecture in an Intelligent Manufacturing System. To develop a multi-agent-based scheduling system for Intelligent Manufacturing, it is necessary to build various functional agents for all the resources and an agent manager to improve the scheduling agility. In this paper, the proposed architecture consists of various autonomous agents that are capable of communicating with each other and making decisions based on their knowledge. The architecture of Intelligent Manufacturing, the scheduling optimization algorithm, the negotiation processes and protocols among the agents are described in detail. A prototype system is built and validated in an illustrative example, which demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach. The experiments prove that the implementation of multi-agent technology in Intelligent Manufacturing System makes the operations much more flexible, economical and energy-efficient.",

            "title": "A Learnability Model for Universal Representations and Its Application to Top-down Induction of Decision Trees",
            "paperAbstract": "Automated inductive learning is a vital part of machine intelligence and the design of intelligent agents. A useful formalization of inductive learning is the model of PAC-learnability. Nevertheless, the ability to learn every target concept expressible in a given representation, as required in the PAC-learnability model, is highly demanding and leads to many negative results for interesting concept classes. A new model of learn-ability, called Universal Learnability or U-learnability, recently has been proposed as a less demanding, average-case variant of PAC-learnability. This paper uses the U-learnability model to analyze a top-down decision tree induction algorithm. Speciically, this paper proves that an idealized variant of the well-known decision tree learning algorithm CART|one of the most successful existing machine learning algorithms|is a U-learner under a natural set of assumptions regarding target hypotheses. (The motivation and description of these assumptions is best delayed until the U-learnability model is described.) Equally interestingly, various related PAC-learning algorithms such as those for k-DNF cannot be used to U-learn under the same assumptions. Finally, the paper raises a number of 1 related open questions and general research directions; open questions include not only U-learnability questions, but also several new PAC-learnability questions and one question regarding a general property of propositional logic.",

DynNetSim combines stochastic modeling with a behavioral simulation framework that synthesizes system dynamics and computational agent paradigms. The resulting framework provides a holistic depiction of networks responding to influences of environmental forces, trends, and disruptive events. In social networks comprised of intentional (goal-directed) entities such as terrorist groups, such responses may encompass opportunistic and adaptive behaviors. DynNetSim also enables exploration of the likely impacts of prospective strategies to change networks, such as attacking adversaries' social networks or reducing vulnerabilities in our own critical infrastructure systems. DynNetSim can enhance diverse counter-terrorism activities including intelligence analysis; critical infrastructure protection; and preparedness planning.",

            "paperAbstract": "This paper presents a framework that supports the detection and mitigation of cognitive biases in visual analytics environments for criminal analysis. Criminal analysts often use visual analytics environments for their analysis of large data sets, for gaining insights on criminal events and patterns of criminal events, and for drawing conclusions and making decisions. However, due to the nature of human cognition, these cognitive processes may lead to systematic errors, so-called cognitive biases. The most prominent and relevant cognitive bias in the intelligence field is the confirmation bias, in which an analyst disproportionally considers and selects information that supports the initial expectation and hypothesis. The framework presented in this paper describes a model, how the possible occurence of the confirmation bias can be detected automatically, while the analyst makes use of the visual environment. Moreover, based on this information, different feedback methods are employed that support and encourage the mitigation of the confirmation bias. This framework is in a work-in-progress state and contains research objectives and directions, the framework design, initial implementations, plans for further development and integration, as well as user-centric evaluation.",

While mining social network data can provide many beneficial services to the user such as personalized experiences, it can also harm the user when used in making critical decisions such as employment. In this work, we investigate the reliability of applying data mining techniques on social network data to predict various individual traits. In spite of the preliminary success of such data mining applications, in this paper, we demonstrate the vulnerabilities of existing state of the art social network data mining techniques when they are facing malicious attacks. Our results indicate that making critical decisions, such as employment or credit approval, based solely on social network data mining results is still premature at this stage. Specifically, we explore Facebook likes data for predicting the traits of a Facebook user, including their political views and sexual orientation. We perform several types of malicious attacks on the predictive models to measure and understand their potential vulnerabilities. We find that existing predictive models built on social network data can be easily manipulated and suggest some countermeasures to prevent some of the proposed attacks.",

Modeling the whole crime situation of a city is critical for policy makers in their efforts to reduce crime and increase citizens' life quality. Chicago has a data platform containing relatively complete crime records from 2001 to present. As each crime record is associated with a location, a timestamp, and a fine-grained crime category, such as \"Theft\" or \"Narcotics\", the data is actually a result of \"human as a sensor\" and \"crowd sensing\", containing rich information and human intelligence that can help diagnose urban crime situations. In this paper we infer the fine-grained crime situation of different times in a year for each community of Chicago, IL in the USA, by using the Chicago crime datasets. We model the crime situation of Chicago with a three dimension tensor, where the three dimensions stand for communities, crime categories, and time slots, respectively. Filling the missing entries of the tensor through a tensor decomposition approach, we recover the overall crime situation throughout Chicago, which is helpful for community crime rate inference, thus influencing officials' decision making to reduce crime.",

Bayesian networks proved their efficiency and reliability in several Artificial Intelligence problems and especially in computer aided decision applications. To diagnose a cerebral tumor in a MRI exam, we need to interpret diverse sequences and to refer to visual characteristics and, also, to the patient clinical information such as age, sex, other diseases, etc. Our main idea is argued by the uncertain aspect embodied of the decision making process. This aspect will be translated as a probabilistic decision model. Our work is tested on several medical cases collected from Sahloul Hospital. The retrieval results seem to be promising.",

            "title": "Belief convergence to facilitate cooperative behaviors",
            "paperAbstract": "In Artificial Intelligence (AI), utility functions are used to compare the relative goodness of an AI system making one decision over another. These utility functions, along with their coefficients and parameters, comprise a set of beliefs. The term \u201cbelief\u201d is used to describe how autonomous systems associate quantified confidences in the existence of things that make up their worldly knowledge; hence, decisions made by an AI system are governed by the states of its belief. Just as in control system theory where the states are quantities used to estimate and describe the behaviors of electrical and/or mechanical systems, belief states are quantities that are used to describe and estimate decision making characteristics. For evolving AI systems (e.g., ones that change their belief states over time through learning) and heterogeneous systems (e.g., ones that do not share a common notion of a global belief), it is important to develop mechanisms that will allow these systems to converge their beliefs, where they can determine how each other \u201cthinks.\u201d This is important since it will allow each agent in a cooperating collective to make decisions that optimally solves their individual needs, along with their collective needs, without requiring explicit communication or a mediator. In this paper, methodologies are presented that facilitate belief convergence. The significance of this study is that we demonstrate how a state observer, such as a Kalman filter, can be used by each agent in a collective to estimate neighboring belief states. This is done with no a priori information of their neighbors' belief states, and by only comparing each individual's estimate for the required effort of the whole collective to perform a group plan.",

            "paperAbstract": "The research project here described aims to contribute to the issue of sustainability of buildings by improving the architectural design process with the development of a decision support tool for the architect. In particular, the research adopts the improvement of existing designs, namely encouraging energyefficient redesigns while improving indoor environmental quality as its strategy to promote sustainability. Redesign strategy is considered not only to extend the life cycle of a building but also to contribute to the realization of the overall transition towards an efficient and clean climate. The starting point for this research is the question of how to develop an integral framework which enables the modelling of design knowledge through more energyefficient dwellings with acceptable indoor comfort in the sustainability context so that it would be possible to deal with qualitative, quantitative, complex and contradictory information at the same time and integrate these into design decision-making processes. This modelling approach is considered to provide a link to developing a tool or a link to be embedded in an existing tool. In the development of such an approach, how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can facilitate an integral understanding of the aspects is raised as a methodological question in terms of information processing and knowledge integration in the form of a design decision support tool. By this way it will be possible to assess the performance of the end result with respect to design choices, beforehand.",

            "paperAbstract": "In portfolio selection problem, the expected return, risk, liquidity etc. cannot be predicted precisely. The investor generally makes his portfolio decision according to his experience and his economic wisdom. So, deterministic portfolio selection is not a good choice for the investor. In most of the recent works on this problem, fuzzy set theory is widely used to model the problem in uncertain environments. This paper utilizes the concept of interval numbers in fuzzy set theory to extend the classical mean-variance (MV) portfolio selection model into mean-variance-skewness (MVS) model with consideration of transaction cost. In addition, some other criteria like short and long term returns, liquidity, dividends, number of assets in the portfolio and the maximum and minimum allowable capital invested in stocks of any selected company are considered. Three different models have been proposed by defining the future financial market optimistically, pessimistically and in the combined form to model the fuzzy MVS portfolio selection problem. In order to solve the models, fuzzy simulation (FS) and elitist genetic algorithm (EGA) are integrated to produce a more powerful and effective hybrid intelligence algorithm (HIA). Finally, our approaches are tested on a set of stock data from Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).",

            "paperAbstract": "In this paper, we propose an auxiliary Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) integrated system for maritime situational awareness (MSA) operations. We bring into account a new and influential asset - human intuition and perception - to the existing semi-automated decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or in the maritime command-and-control centers. For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text1 is called \u201crisk\u201d if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with. Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime geographical locations, dates and times. These distributions are captured and used to anchor the span of \u201crisks\u201d as they are described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence classification algorithms, e.g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk classification performance. Empirical results show that our NLP/ML-based system can extract variable-length risk spans from the textual reports with about 90% correctness.",

This unique corpus provides useful data for formal and informal logic theory, for natural-language research in linguistics, and for artificial intelligence research. More importantly, the article discusses lessons learned from developing protocols for manually extracting the logical structure and generating the logic models. It identifies sub-tasks in the extraction process, discusses challenges to automation, and provides insights into possible solutions for automation. In particular, the framework and strategies developed here, together with the corpus data, should allow \u201ctop\u2013down\u201d and contextual approaches to automation, which can supplement \u201cbottom-up\u201d linguistic approaches. Illustrations throughout the article use examples drawn from the Corpus.",

In this paper, we present a novel multi-agent-based architecture for DSS, called agent-based open connectivity for decision support systems (AOCD). The AOCD architecture adopts a hybrid agent network topology that makes use of a unique feature called matrix-agent connection. This architecture is able to overcome the difficulties in concurrent control and synchronous communication problems that plague many decentralized systems. Performance analysis has been carried out on this architecture and we find that it is able to provide a high degree of flexibility and efficiency compared with other architectures",

            "paperAbstract": "Predicting tumor malignancies is an important but difficult task. For many tumors, especially neural and endocrine tumors, traditional pathological and histological analyses often can not effectively distinguish benign from malignant tumors. Developing synergistic bioinformatics and computational intelligence system is effective, because deterministic cancer markers do not always exist in individual patients. We proposed a parallel paradigm of cancer and use a number of ensemble methods including boosting, bagging and consensus networking, and have designed a novel classification scheme that advantageously combines several computational intelligence algorithms such as the variants of self-organizing feature map (SOFM) algorithms and the maximum contrast tree (RMCT) algorithms. Boosting and bagging have been advantageously combined. When all of the above are integrated into one synergistic intelligent medical decision system, the prediction power for the task has been significantly boosted. The system and features are validated by diagnosing new patients and by a number of laboratory molecular biology measurements. The outcomes of the research have improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning, and may lead to diagnose microscopic diseases and better understanding of human genome mechanisms relating to malignant transformation",

Threat evaluation which is the key factor of analysis of a battlefield situation is a technology that evaluates threat values on the situation in accordance with air intelligence gotten through radar and provides information about weapon assignment. This stage requires the most accurate information than other stage in a battlefield situation. Most of data of threat evaluation is calculated by sensed sensor values and transmitted, but presentation of incorrect links of sensor data or data omission that could happen on the existing technique could cause confusion over decision making in a battlefield situation. Thus, the links must be defined accurately through knowledge of experts on various sensor data domain, and reliable threat consequences must be provided through adaptation and learning about unpredictable battlefields due to data omission. On this paper, a fusion system, a dynamic neuro fuzzy knowledge based inference system, which is favorable to adaptation and learning and presentation of expertise, is suggested and applied to threat evaluation.",

            "paperAbstract": "The vision for future Soldier-robot relationships has supported the transition of the robot's role from a tool to an integrated team member. This vision has provided support for the advancement of robot autonomy and intelligence as a means to better support action and cognitive decision-making in the network-centric operational environment. To accomplish this goal, the Soldier's perspective of the human-robot interaction must be further developed, as it directly impacts overall situation management: mission planning, operational roles, function allocation, and decision-making. Here we present a theoretical concept paper that promotes using the foundation of network science to better understand how and why advances in effective Soldier-robot situation management may be realized. We begin by providing a primer on how a network science approach may be used to understand multi-agent teams and network-centric operations. This is followed with a review on the impact of human perception on the human-robot team network structure. Two key points are highlighted. First, the network structure is influenced by the extent to which a Soldier-robot coupling performs independent operations. Second, the degree of automaticity for several properties of the robot specifies the strength of their networked relationship. We conclude with possible advantages of using a network science approach for understanding situation management of Soldier-robot teams in an operational environment. This approach provides a structure for creating visual maps of team structures to understand perceived and anticipated role interdependency, which thus provides the foundation for developing a mathematical description of the dynamic Soldier-robot relationship.",

Experimentally identifying methylation positions in protein sequences is time-consuming and costly. In order to provide insightful advice and reduce cost for further experiments, we propose a novel granular decision fusion framework based on granular computing, computational intelligence, and statistical learning. Algorithms are designed under this framework to predict methylation sites. Since methylation sites rarely appeared, the known data are imbalanced. Sampling and clustering is used to create different sub-sets and represent them with cluster centers. Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are built for these sub datasets. Finally, granular decisions are fused to determine possible methylation sites. Simulation results show that the new granular decision fusion system has high prediction accuracy.",

            "paperAbstract": "Decision making on weapons of mass effect (WME) proliferation and counter-proliferation is information driven. However, the large data requirements, along with associated knowledge gaps and intelligence uncertainties, impedes optimal strategy selection. Combining Bayesian analysis, agent based modeling (ABM), and information theory within a security informatics context can aid understanding of dynamic WME proliferation and counter-proliferation pathways and possibilities. The Bayesian ABM Nonproliferation Enterprise (BANE) was developed to incorporate large databases and information sets. There are three broad BANE agent classes: 1) proliferator, 2) defensive, and 3) neutral. Within each agent class exists significant flexibility for them pursuing different objectives. Bayesian analysis cover the technical linkages realistically tying proliferation pathway process steps together. In BANE, Bayesian networks using the Netica software program provide a wide array of scientific and engineering pathway options. Information theory, especially entropy reduction and mutual information, in a Bayesian security informatics arrangement help identify optimal technical areas to master or disrupt. Concurrently, interlocking factors such as available resources, technical sophistication, time horizons, detection risks, and agent affinities impact agents' ability to achieve their goals. Actions taken by one BANE agent on the proliferation or counter-proliferation front affect its future opportunities and those of potential partner or adversarial agents. An explanation of the BANE framework and several key security informatics aspects crucial to WME proliferation and counter-proliferation analysis are provided.",

            "paperAbstract": "With the extensive collection of various trajectories, a lot of trajectory mining methods have been developed and brought into effect in different applications. The same is true for trajectory clustering. It enables the construction of diverse applications (e.g., mobile social networks) and can promote the intelligence of existing services (e.g., optimizing public transit). In the paper, we propose a three-phase clustering strategy ODTC (Origin Destination pair oriented Trajectories Clustering) for the massive trajectories in the form of OD (Origin Destination) pairs and demonstrate the impact of trajectory clustering on evaluating and adjusting public transit operations. In our ODTC strategy, trajectories are partitioned in the first phase by coarsegrained clustering, reflecting an idea of divide and conquer. While during the second phase of fine-grained clustering, we model the relations of OD pairs as a sparse graph where the spatial and temporal features as well as the constraints of road networks are integrated into the similarity of trajectories. Then we apply a spectral clustering algorithm on the graph to capture clusters. In particular, in the third phase, we borrow the idea from text data mining and give a feasible method to mine the semantics of clusters. As a case study, we perform ODTC on the large-scale trajectories from the Beijing Public Transport Group. From the clustering results, we can observe the mobility patterns of bus passengers. Further, we exploit the clustering results to discover the dynamics of bus operations, evaluate the bus lines and provide support for making the decisions on bus operations.",

            "paperAbstract": "Decision analysis is an appealing methodology with which to provide decision support to the practicing physician. However, its use in the clinical setting is impeded because computer- based explanations of decision-theoretic advice are difficult to generate without resorting to mathematical arguments. Nevertheless, human decision analysts generate useful and in tuitive explanations based on decision trees. To facilitate the use of decision theory in a computer-based decision support system, the authors developed a computer program that uses symbolic reasoning techniques to generate nonquantitative explanations of the results of decision analyses. A combined approach has been implemented to explain the differences in expected utility among branches of a decision tree. First, the mathematical relationships inherent in the structure of the tree are used to find any asymmetries in tree structure or inequalities among analogous decision variables that are responsible for a difference in expected utility. Next, an explanation technique is selected and applied to the most significant variables, creating a symbolic expression that justifies the decision. Finally, the symbolic expression is converted to English-language text, thereby generating an explanation that justifies the desirability of the choice with the greater expected utility. The explanation does not refer to mathematical formulas, nor does it include probability or utility values. The results suggest that explanations produced by a combination of decision analysis and symbolic processing techniques may be more persuasive and acceptable to clinicians than those produced by either technique alone.

            "paperAbstract": "The enormous services obtainable by bank and postal systems are not 100\u00a0% guaranteed due to variability of handwriting styles. Various methods based on neural networks have been suggested to address this issue. Unfortunately, they often fall into local optima that arises from the use of old learning methods. Global optimization methods provided new directions for neural networks evolution that may be useful in recognition. This paper develops efficient algorithms that compute globally optimal solutions by exploiting the benefits of both swarm intelligence and neuro-evolution in a way to improve the overall performance of a character recognition system. Various adaptations implied to both MLP and RBF networks have been suggested namely: particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the bees algorithm (BA) for characters classification, MLP training or RBF design by co-evolution and effective combinations of MLPs, RBFs or SVMs as an attempt to overcome the drawbacks of old recognition methods. Results proved that networks combination proposals ensure the highest improvement compared to either standard MLP and RBF networks, the co-evolutionary alternatives or other classifiers combination based on common combination rules namely majority voting, the fusion rules of min, max, sum, average, product and Bayes, Decision template and the Behavior Knowledge Space (BKS).",

            "title": "Novamente: An Integrative Architecture for General Intelligence",
            "paperAbstract": "The Novamente AI Engine is briefly reviewed. The overall architecture is unique, drawing on system-theoretic ideas regarding complex mental dynamics and associated emergent patterns. We describe how these are facilitated by a novel knowledge representation which allows diverse cognitive processes to interact effectively. We then elaborat e the two primary cognitive algorithms used to construct these processes: probabilistic term logic (PTL), and the Bayesi n Optimization Algorithm (BOA). PTL is a highly flexible inference framework, applicable to domains involving uncertain, dynamic data, and autonomous agents in complex environments. BOA is a population-based optimization algorithm which can incorporate prior knowledge. While originally designed to operate on bit strings, our extended version also learns programs and predicates with variable length and tree-like structure, used to represent actions, perceptions, and internal state. We detail some of the specif ic dynamics and structures we expect to emerge through the interaction of the cognitive processes, outline our approach to training the system through experiential interactive le arning, and conclude with a description of some recent results obtained with our partial implementation, including practical work in bioinformatics, natural language processing, an d knowledge discovery. Introduction and Motivation The primary motivation behind the Novamente AI Engin e is to build a system that can achieve complex goals in complex environments, a synopsis of the definition of intelligence given in (Goertzel 1993). The emphasis is on t he plurality of goals and environments. A chess-playing program is not a general intelligence, nor is a data minin g e gine, nor is a program that can cleverly manipulate a re searcher-constructed microworld. A general intelligence must be able to carry out a variety of different tasks i n a variety of different contexts, generalizing knowledge between contexts and building up a context and task independent pragmatic understanding of itself and the world. First among the tenets underlying the design is an unde rstanding of mind as the interpenetration of a physical sys tem with an abstract set of patterns, where a pattern is quantified in terms of algorithmic information theory ( Goertzel 1997, Chaitin 1987). In essence, a pattern in an entity is an abstract program that is smaller than the entity, and can rapidly compute the entity or its approximation. For instance, a pattern in a drawing of a sine curve might be a program that can compute the curve from a formula. The understanding of mind as pattern ties in naturally with the interpretation of intelligence, at the most abstract level, as a problem of finding compact programs that en capsulate patterns in the environment, in the system it self, and in behavior. This concept was first seriously elab or ted in Solomonoff\u2019s work on the theory of induction (Solomonoff 1964, Solomonoff 1978), and has been developed more rigorously and completely in Hutter\u2019s recent work (Hutter 2000), which integrates a body of prior work on algorithmic information theory and statistical decision theory to formalize the concept of general intelligence. N ovamente can be proven to be arbitrarily intelligent acco rding to Hutter\u2019s definition, if given sufficient computationa l resources. Baum has expounded the cognitive science implications of this perspective on intelligence (Baum 2004). Another tenet of the Novamente approach is the real ization that intelligence most naturally emerges through sit uated and social experience. Abstract thoughts and representations are facilitated through the recognition and manip ulation of patterns in environments with which a system has sensorimotor interaction; see for example (Boroditsky an d Ramscar 2002). This interaction, embodied in the right cognitive architecture, leads to autonomy, experiential interactive learning, and goal-oriented self-modification; a mind continually adapts based on what it learns from its environment and the entities it interacts with. The final tenet is a view of the internal organization of a mind as a collection of semi-autonomous agents embedded in a common substrate (Goertzel 1993). In this vein, No vamente is less extreme than some alternative approach es such as Minsky\u2019s Society of Mind (Minsky 1986), where agents are largely independent. Novamente is based on th e idea that minds are self-organizing systems of agents, which interact with some degree of individual freedom, but are also constrained by an overall architecture invol ving a degree of inbuilt executive control, which nudges the selforganizing dynamics towards emergent hierarchical organization. These abstract principles are coherently unified in a philosophy of cognition called the psynet model (Goertzel, 1997), which is foundational to Novamente, and provides a moderately detailed theory of the emergent structures a nd dynamics in intelligent systems. In the model, mental f unctions such as perception, action, reasoning and procedure learning are described in terms of interactions between agents. Any mind, at a given interval of time, is assu med to have a particular goal system, which may be expressed explicitly and/or implicitly. Thus, the dynamics of a cogni tive system are understood to be governed by two main forces: self-organization and goal-oriented behavior. Mor e specifically, several primary dynamical principles ar e posited, including: Association. Patterns, when given attention, spread some of this attention to other patterns that they have pre viously been associated with in some way. Furthermore, there is Peirce\u2019s \u201claw of mind\u201d (Peirce 1892), which could be paraphrased in modern terms as stating that the mind is an associative memory network, whose dynamics dictate tha t every idea in the memory is an active agent, continuall y acting on those ideas with which the memory associates it. Differential attention allocation. Patterns that have been valuable for goal-achievement are given more attention , and are encouraged to participate in giving rise to new pa tterns. Pattern creation. Patterns that have been valuable for goal-achievement are mutated and combined with each other to yield new patterns. Credit Assignment. Habitual patterns in the system that are found valuable for goal-achievement are explicitly rei nforced and made more habitual. Furthermore, the network of patterns in the system must give rise to the following large-scale emergent structu res: Hierarchical network. Patterns are habitually in relations of control over other patterns that represent more spe cialized aspects of themselves. Heterarchical network. The system retains a memory of which patterns have previously been associated with each other in any way. Dual network. Hierarchical and heterarchical structures are combined, with the dynamics of the two structures working together harmoniously. Self structure. A portion of the network of patterns forms into an approximate (fractal) image of the overall netw ork of patterns. Structures and Algorithms The psynet model does not tell you how to build a mind, only, in general terms, what a mind should be like. It would be possible to create many different AI designs based loosely on the psynet model; one example of this i s the Webmind AI Engine developed in the late 1990\u2019s (Goertzel et al. 2000, Goertzel 2002). Novamente, as a specif ic system inspired by the psynet model, owes many of its details to the limitations imposed by contemporary hardware performance and software design methodologies. Furthermore, Novamente is intended to utilize a minimal number of different knowledge representation structures and cognitive algorithms. Regarding knowledge representation, we have chosen an intermediate-level atom network representation which somewhat resembles classic semantic networks but has dynamic aspects that are more similar to neural netw orks. This enables a breadth of cognitive dynamics, but in a way that utilizes drastically less memory and processing t han a more low-level, neural network style approach. The detai ls of the representation have been designed for compatibili ty with the system\u2019s cognitive algorithms. Regarding cognition, we have reduced the set of fundamental algorithms to two: Probabilistic Term Logic (PTL ) and the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BOA). The former deals with the local creation of pieces of new knowledge from existing pieces of knowledge; the latter is more oriented towards global optimization, and creates new knowledge by integrating large amounts of existing knowledge. These two algorithms themselves interact in several ways, representing the necessary interdependenc e of local and holistic cognition. Having reduced the basic knowledge representations and cognitive algorithms to this minimal core, the diverse f unctional specializations required for pragmatic general int elligence are provided by the introduction of a number of node and link types in the atom network, and a high-level architecture consisting of a number of functionally specia lized lobes each deploying the same structures and algorithms for particular purposes (see Figure 1 below). Knowledge Representation Knowledge representation in Novamente involves two levels, the explicit and the emergent. This section focuses on the explicit level; the emergent level involves selforganizing structures called maps, and will be discussed later, after the fundamental cognitive dynamics have bee n introduced. Explicit knowledge representation in Novamente involves discrete units (atoms) of several types: nodes, links, and containers, which are ordered or unordered collections of atoms. Each atom is associated with a truth value, indicating, roughly, the degree to which it correctly descr ibes the world. Novamente has been designed with several different types of truth values in mind; the simplest of th ese consists of a pair of value denoting ",

            "paperAbstract": "Taking inspiration from neural principles of decision-making is of particular interest to help improve adaptivity of artificial systems. Research at the crossroads of neuroscience and artificial intelligence in the last decade has helped understanding how the brain organizes reinforcement learning (RL) processes (the adaptation of decisions based on feedback from the environment). The current challenge is now to understand how the brain flexibly regulates parameters of RL such as the exploration rate based on the task structure, which is called meta-learning ([1]: Doya, 2002). Here, we propose a computational mechanism of exploration regulation based on real neurophysiological and behavioral data recorded in monkey prefrontal cortex during a visuo-motor task involving a clear distinction between exploratory and exploitative actions. We first fit trial-by-trial choices made by the monkeys with an analytical reinforcement learning model. We find that the model which has the highest likelihood of predicting monkeys' choices reveals different exploration rates at different task phases. In addition, the optimized model has a very high learning rate, and a reset of action values associated to a cue used in the task to signal condition changes. Beyond classical RL mechanisms, these results suggest that the monkey brain extracted task regularities to tune learning parameters in a task-appropriate way. We finally use these principles to develop a neural network model extending a previous cortico-striatal loop model. In our prefrontal cortex component, prediction error signals are extracted to produce feedback categorization signals. The latter are used to boost exploration after errors, and to attenuate it during exploitation, ensuring a lock on the currently rewarded choice. This model performs the task like monkeys, and provides a set of experimental predictions to be tested by future neurophysiological recordings.",

            "paperAbstract": "Recently strong AI emerged from artificial intelligence due to need for a thinking machine. In this domain, it is necessary to deal with dynamic incomplete data and understanding of how machines make their decision is also important, especially in information system domain. One type of learning called Covering Algorithms (CA) can be used instead of the difficult statistical machine learning methods to produce simple rule with powerful prediction ability. However, although using CA as the base of strong AI is a novel idea, doing so with the current methods available is not possible. Thus, this paper presents a novel CA (RULES-IT) and tests its performance over incomplete data. This algorithm is the first incremental algorithm in its family, and CA as a whole, that transfer rules from different domains and introduce intelligent aspects using simple representation. The performance of RULES-IT will be tested over incomplete and complete data along with other algorithms in the literature. It will be validated using 5-fold cross validation in addition to Friedman with Nemenyi post hoc tests to measure the significance and rank the algorithms.",

The AI trends and scenarios have been elicited using expert Delphi as well as via a simulation of a hybrid discrete-time and discrete-event control system. The system components include a complex information society model, which describes the evolution of social, economic and scientific factors relevant to the production and adsorption of intelligent technologies. The discrete-event component is tailored to model the and science and technology (S&T) development processes in each area under consideration. We specifically investigated the development of intelligent internet technologies, including e-health, e-government and expert systems. Special attention has been paid to decision support systems, digital creativity, and recommenders. Other project work-packages encompass neurocognitive and computer vision systems, as well as quantum and molecular computing. Finally, we will present the results related to the evolution of rule-based and creativity support systems in the context of global economic and research trends.",

Second, they avoid the difficulty of modeling human decision-making by generating orders stochastically. This paper reports on a computational experiment in which a strategic agent trading on endogenous market signals is embedded in an otherwise stochastic order book simulation.

It is closely related to the US concept of \"network-centric operations\". A core requirement for NEC is \"active intelligence\" where information streams from multiple sources can be dynamically blended and fused into the relevant form for a decision maker. We have identified \"smart queries\" and \"adaptive data\" (SQuAD) as the key components of active intelligence, and these form the basis of a current research programme. In this paper we outline three existing research streams that can contribute to the SQuAD project by using soft computing and computational intelligence to merge semi-structured data and taxonomic categories",

            "paperAbstract": "The collaboration between humans and intelligent agents keeps increasing as the technology advances. In this sense, each can rely on the other's strengths to achieve the best overall performance. But as intelligent agents play an increasingly escalating role as a partner rather than mere tools, it is imperative that we understand how humans are influenced by such agents. This is so as to achieve a certain level of persuasiveness to ensure human compliance with intelligent agents in times of need, and also prevent over-reliance on such agents, which may make humans susceptible to manipulation. Reviewing the literature from human-computer interaction, persuasion, and decision-making processes, this study examined the effect of labelling source expertise (i.e., title) on the human decision-making process, when there is not an agreement between human and robot partners. Specifically, we conducted an experiment (n = 88) to investigate how perceived expertise of a robot resulted in the attractiveness, intelligence and credibility of the robot, and how these perceptions influence the level of cooperation and compliance in a desert survival game. The results showed that participants evaluated the robot as more credible when labelled as expert, compared to when labelled as novice. The results of a mediation analysis also showed that perceived credibility successfully mediated the effect of title on cooperation and compliance when there was a conflict in the ranking order of items between each participant and the robot. Implications for future development of artificial intelligence and future research directions are discussed.",

Age is a major risk factor for cognitive impairments and the number of people living with cognitive impairment is expected to grow dramatically. This paper presents a method and an infrastructure for i) monitoring behaviors of cognitive impaired people ii) detecting dangerous situations that involve patients iii) recovering the current situation whereas an anomaly is detected. The method adopts the Situation-Awareness paradigm to model monitoring infrastructure, an Artificial Intelligence techniques for the identification of patient's behaviors. Test performed in laboratory and theoretic results show the validity of the approach. The research activity aims to develop a safe environments for cognitive impaired people.",

            "paperAbstract": "A model of decentralized problem solving, called distributed constrained heuristic search (DCHS), that provides both structure and focus in individual agent search spaces to optimize decisions in the global space, is presented. The model achieves this by integrating decentralized constraint satisfaction and heuristic search. It is a formalism suitable for describing a large set of distributed artificial intelligence problems. The notion of textures that allow agents to operate in an asynchronous concurrent manner is introduced. The use of textures coupled with distributed asynchronous backjumping, a type of distributed dependency-directed backtracking that the authors have developed, enables agents to instantiate variables in such a way as to substantially reduce backtracking. The approach has been tested experimentally in the domain of decentralized job-shop scheduling. A formulation of distributed job-shop scheduling as a DCHS and experimental results are presented. >",

            "paperAbstract": "Undoubtedly, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) has gained its importance through the statement that acquiring a new customer is several times more costly than retaining and selling additional products to existing customers. Consequently, marketing practitioners are currently often focusing on retaining customers for as long as possible. However, recent findings in relationship marketing literature have shown that large differences exist within the group of long-life customers in terms of spending and spending evolution. Therefore, this paper focuses on introducing a measure of a customer's future spending evolution that might improve relationship marketing decision making. In this study, from a marketing point of view, we focus on predicting whether a newly acquired customer will increase or decrease his/her future spending from initial purchase information. This is essentially a classification task. The main contribution of this study lies in comparing and evaluating several Bayesian network classifiers with statistical and other artificial intelligence techniques for the purpose of classifying customers in the binary classification problem at hand. Certain Bayesian network classifiers have been recently proposed in the artificial intelligence literature as probstudy. We discuss and evaluate several types of Bayesian network classifiers and their corresponding structure learning algorithms. We contribute to the literature by providing experimental evidence that: (1) Bayesian network classifiers offer an interesting and viable alternative for our customer lifecycle slope estimation problem; (2) the Markov Blanket concept allows for a natural form of attribute selection that was very effective for the application at hand; (3) the sign of the slope can be predicted with a powerful and parsimonious general, unrestricted Bayesian network classifier; (4) a set of three variables measuring the volume of initial purchases and the degree to which customers originally buy in different categories, are powerful predictors for estimating the sign of the slope, and might therefore provide desirable additional information for relationship marketing decision making.",

            "paperAbstract": "In this paper, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is introduced for controlling the Pac-Man character in the real-time game Ms Pac-Man. MCTS is used to find an optimal path for an agent at each turn, determining the move to make based on the results of numerous randomized simulations. Several enhancements are introduced in order to adapt MCTS to the real-time domain. Ms Pac-Man is an arcade game, in which the protagonist has several goals but no conclusive terminal state. Unlike games such as Chess or Go there is no state in which the player wins the game. Instead, the game has two subgoals, 1) surviving and 2) scoring as many points as possible. Decisions must be made in a strict time constraint of 40 ms. The Pac-Man agent has to compete with a range of different ghost teams, hence limited assumptions can be made about their behavior. In order to expand the capabilities of existing MCTS agents, four enhancements are discussed: 1) a variable-depth tree; 2) simulation strategies for the ghost team and Pac-Man; 3) including long-term goals in scoring; and 4) reusing the search tree for several moves with a decay factor \u03b3. The agent described in this paper was entered in both the 2012 World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI'12, Brisbane, Qld., Australia) and the 2012 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG'12, Granada, Spain) Pac-Man Versus Ghost Team competitions, where it achieved second and first places, respectively. In the experiments, we show that using MCTS is a viable technique for the Pac-Man agent. Moreover, the enhancements improve overall performance against four different ghost teams.",

            "paperAbstract": "Due to the limited computing resources of cell phones and the relative lack of bandwidth of cell phone networks, broadcasting live streaming video from cell phone camera is challenging. Prior work has shown that data compression using wavelet and sub-band aligned integer run-length encoding can produce real-time streaming video. However, such transmissions can result in numerous dropped video frames. The work presented here, a real-time decision making mobile streaming video algorithm, builds upon this earlier work by adapting the number of video frames transmitted per second based on the current load of the cell phone network and the data size of the video frames. Using artificial intelligence, the algorithm makes real-time decisions to improve the video delivery rate by an average of 32%.",

            "paperAbstract": "Business owners are faced with complex problems and are required to make decisions on a daily basis. The purpose of this study was to investigate complex problem solving (CPS) between experts and novices and to explore the competing theories of expert-rigidity versus expert-adaptability, as part of exploring which theory better explains crystallized intelligence. Participants were 140 business owners, business management undergraduate students and psychology students. Each participant managed a highly complex simulated chocolate company. Decisions and systems data were automatically saved in log files. Results revealed that small business owners performed best, followed by business students and then psychology students. A process analysis revealed that experts compared to novices spent more time initially exploring the complex situation. Experts were found to have greater flexibility in their decisions, having made the most personnel and advertising changes in response to situational demands. Adaptability and flexibility were predictive of performance, with results supporting the adaptability/flexibility theory of expertise. This study shows the influence of expertise on complex problem solving and the importance of flexibility when solving dynamic business problems. Complex business simulations are not only useful tools for research, but could also be used as tools in training programs teaching decision making and problem solving strategies.",

Different from those existing solutions offered by IT companies and other techniques, like Web Service, which usually are approaches for data integration on high-level, we contribute a novel solution for data integration of remote devices on low-level. This paper describes a fully scalable and configurable middleware which uses a range of technologies-Component-Oriented Programming, Message Queuing, XML and Topic-based Publish/Subscribe design pattern-to release the power of parallel processing with distributed data. Steps for the design and implementation of remote data integration middleware are the main topic of this paper. It is designed as a soft-gateway to link upper-level PCs with lower-level data transfer units, and implemented by extracting the key part of data communication out of its original holder so that the UI only cares about how to display data.",

            "title": "Opening our worlds",
            "paperAbstract": "In his original article in 1950, Turing recognized the importance of defining the right world within which to explore the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and thinking machines. \u201cWe hope that machines will eventually compete with men in all purely intellectual fields. But which are the best ones to start with? Even this is a difficult decision.\u201d Because AI EDAM focuses on AI for design, analysis, and manufacturing, this is a central question to the Journal. Where can AI have the greatest impact on design, analysis, and manufacture applications? Further, where can such applications provide interesting insights and issues that challenge the theories and methods applied? In the early years of AI, and of AI EDAM, problems tended to be well defined, although still difficult, and the algorithms and systems to solve these problems were also typically closed. This was necessary to develop the first steps in this new research area, gain understanding, and show potential. However, now is the time to rethink the worlds we have defined in our research and open them up. I suggest some dimensions to think about. The early writings in AI tended to take the human out of the loop, focusing on what machines could do autonomously and automatically. However, we have learned now that, most often, the human needs to be in the loop somewhere. Are we really seeking human-competitive results by a machine alone anyway or is the whole, that is, machine plus human, greater than the sum? Although initially perhaps thought to be \u201ccheating,\u201d it has been shown that adding humans does not necessarily make problems easier, but it also allows us to open our worlds. In a similar direction, there is a trend from earlier closed systems (i.e., expert systems) to open support systems that are customizable by users so that they can incorporate evolving knowledge, because we know that knowledge always changes. Further, so that we can provide methods and tools that people want to use, we need to better understand humans and their cognitive processes during design, analysis, and manufacturing. The next part of our world we need to think about is the scale of problems we define to tackle. Small-scale \u201ctoy\u201d problems are no longer enough. Although they serve as good initial benchmarks, we need to move as a community to more complex, \u201cindustrial-strength\u201d applications or as close as possible to validate our methods. Remember that this in turn can provide new insights about theories and methods! Even better are applications that are important economically and societally. Because of advances in computer science and available software, especially open source, we are also in the position to build better software prototypes and validate methods with users, such as students but better yet designers and engineers. Another part of our world that we need to think about is the field or domain in which problems are defined. Most products today, whether consumer products, buildings, airplanes, cars, or machines, combine a complex mixture of disciplines that often include mechanical, structural, electrical, software, and, more recently, service aspects. Thus, the approaches and methods we are developing need to often move from single discipline approaches to tackle multiple disciplines. The complexity of their integration in design, analysis, and manufacture creates great challenges and thus great potential for new AI approaches. Finally, when returning to reading some of the classic AI and AI EDAM references, I am always amazed at how clear the early ideas seemed and the impression that the fields of AI, engineering, and cognitive sciences were more closely intertwined at the time. In the process of working out the details, the disciplines have diverged along the way. Now, there is a trend toward their reintegration and transfer of the latest theories, methods, software approaches, and understanding among disciplines, which is needed to tackle more complex application scenarios. These are the challenges I suggest to think about to open your worlds. I look forward to the next 10 years of AI EDAM playing a key role in advancing this important, interdisciplinary field.",

            "paperAbstract": "The wisdom of crowds has been recognized as an effective decision making mechanism by aggregating information from different individuals to derive an overall decision. However, in this information aggregation process, individuals may be influenced by various factors and provide biased claims (or individual level decisions), especially when such claims are related to their economic benefits. In this research, we investigate crowd's claims in binary decisions under explicit constant influence and aim to understand their real but hidden belief (distribution) on the decision. Particularly, we take fixed odds betting on binary events as a representative scenario in this study. We model the relationship between event probability and crowds' belief distribution as a linear combination of Beta distributions. Taking a Maximization Likelihood Estimation (MLE) paradigm, we estimate the parameters of this distribution based on observed crowds' bets. In this process, we model individual betting decisions under the influence of odds using prospect theory. We apply the framework on a real world dataset of Olympic Games outcome betting. After identifying betting participants' hidden belief distribution, we also found that crowds' belief tend to tilt to the high probability side of the event (if there is no outside influence), which partially explains why the wisdom of crowds can make decision marking easier. We believe this paper contributes to the literature of crowd intelligence and can help generating more accurate digestions of the wisdom of crowds.",

            "paperAbstract": "A model of decentralized problem solving, called distributed constrained heuristic search (DCHS), that provides both structure and focus in individual agent search spaces to optimize decisions in the global space, is presented. The model achieves this by integrating decentralized constraint satisfaction and heuristic search. It is a formalism suitable for describing a large set of distributed artificial intelligence problems. The notion of textures that allow agents to operate in an asynchronous concurrent manner is introduced. The use of textures coupled with distributed asynchronous backjumping, a type of distributed dependency-directed backtracking that the authors have developed, enables agents to instantiate variables in such a way as to substantially reduce backtracking. The approach has been tested experimentally in the domain of decentralized job-shop scheduling. A formulation of distributed job-shop scheduling as a DCHS and experimental results are presented. >",

In this paper we study the psychosocial perspective and the implications of insider threat prediction via social media, Open Source Intelligence and user generated content classification. Inductively, we propose a prediction method by evaluating the predisposition towards law enforcement and authorities, a personal psychosocial trait closely connected to the manifestation of malevolent insiders. We propose a methodology to detect users holding negative attitude towards authorities. For doing so, we facilitate a brief analysis of the medium (YouTube), machine learning techniques and a dictionary-based approach, in order to detect comments expressing negative attitude. Thus, we can draw conclusions over a user behavior and beliefs via the content the user generated within the limits a social medium. We also use an assumption free flat data representation technique in order to decide over the user's attitude and improve the scalability of our method. Furthermore, we compare the results of each method and highlight the common behavior and characteristics manifested by the users. As privacy violations may well-rise when using such methods, their use should be restricted only on exceptional cases, e.g. when appointing security officers or decision-making staff in critical infrastructures.",

            "title": "Towards Intelligent Team Composition and Maneuvering in Real-Time Strategy Games",
            "paperAbstract": "Players of real-time strategy (RTS) games are often annoyed by the inability of the game AI to select and move teams of units in a natural way. Units travel and battle separately, resulting in huge losses and the AI looking unintelligent, as can the choice of units sent to counteract the opponents. Players are affected as well as computer commanded factions because they cannot micromanage all team related issues. We suggest improving AI behavior by combining well-known computational intelligence techniques applied in an original way. Team composition for battling spatially distributed opponent groups is supported by a learning self-organizing map (SOM) that relies on an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to adapt it to the game. Different abilities of unit types are thus employed in a near-optimal way, reminiscent of human ad hoc decisions. Team movement is greatly enhanced by flocking and influence map-based path finding, leading to a more natural behavior by preserving individual motion types. The team decision to either attack or avoid a group of enemy units is easily parametrizable, incorporating team characteristics from fearful to daredevil. We demonstrate that these two approaches work well separately, but also that they go together naturally, thereby leading to an improved and flexible group behavior.",

            "paperAbstract": "In the last two decades the advancement of AI/CI methods in classical board and card games (such as Chess, Checkers, Othello, Go, Poker, Bridge, ...) has been enormous. In nearly all ldquoworld famousrdquo board games humans have been decisively conquered by machines (actually Go remains almost the last redoubt of human supremacy). In the above perspective the natural question is whether there is still any need for further development of CI methods in this area. What kind of goals can be achieved on this path? What are (if any) the challenging problems in the field? The paper tries to discuss these issues with respect to classical board mind games and provides (highly subjective) partial answers to some of the open questions. The main conclusion from the arguments specified in the paper is that one of the major, ultimate goals of CI in classical board game research concerns possessing by machines the ability to mimic human approach to game playing. This includes human-specific learning methods (learning from scratch, pattern-based learning, multitask and unsupervised learning) and human-type reasoning and decision making (efficient position estimation, abstraction and generalization of game features, autonomous development of evaluation functions, effective pre-ordering of moves, and selective, contextual search). Three of the above listed issues i.e. autonomous learning, knowledge discovery and intuition are discussed in this paper in more detail.",

The data mining system makes use of the decision tree algorithm and classification model in exploring the meaningful information, which is useful in the process of decision making. Subsequently, the rules discovered by the data mining system are expressed through the rule based knowledge presentation method of the expert system. The intelligent CIM system is applied to semiconductor packing factories and also point at the great fluctuation of dynamic random access memory prices. The contribution can increase business competitiveness, reduce production cost, and promote the rate of available promise for order.",

            "paperAbstract": "Usually, integration of business intelligence (BI) from realistic telecom enterprise is by packing data warehouse (DW), OLAP, data mining and reporting from different vendors together. As a result, BI system users are transferred to a reporting system with reports, data models, dimensions and measures predefined by system designers. As a result of survey, 85% of DW projects failed to meet their intended objectives. In this paper, we investigate how to integrate BI packages into an adaptive and flexible knowledge portal by constructing an internal link and communication channel from top-level business concepts to underlying enterprise information systems (EIS). An approach of three-level ontology services is developed, which implements unified naming, directory and transport of ontology services, and ontology mapping and query parsing among conceptual view, analytical view and physical view from user interfaces through DW to EIS. Experiments on top of real telecom EIS shows that our solution for integrating BI presents much stronger power to support operational decision making more user-friendly and adaptively compared with those simply combining BI products presently available together.",

            "paperAbstract": "Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a relatively new sampling best-first method to search for optimal decisions. The MCTS' popularity is based on its extraordinary results in the challenging two-player based game Go, a game considered much harder than Chess and that until very recently was considered unfeasible for Artificial Intelligence methods. Different MCTS variants have been proposed, mainly to enhance its capabilities. Perhaps, one of the main limitations of this approach is its applicability in scenarios where multiple agents (more than two) are required. Some works have made an attempt to overcome this limitation by using a vector of reward values for each agent and allowing the algorithm to find an optimal equilibrium strategy. Inspired by these approaches, in this work we make an effort to explore a new proposal for handling multiple agents in MCTS by using a vector of values of what the agents need to do (defined tasks) instead of a vector of rewards for each agent. To achieve this we use a rather simple, but powerful heuristic that estimates the desired values of this vector. That is, a set of values that could lead to the optimal completion of the task. We tested this idea in a real-world scenario rather than using it in games as traditionally done. The results achieved by our proposed approach, named Heuristic-Based Multi-Agent Monte Carlo Tree Search, indicate the feasibility of using heuristics in the MCTS algorithm in situations where more than two agents are required.",

            "paperAbstract": "This paper proposes a novel combination of artificial intelligence planning and other techniques for improving decision-making in the context of multi-step multimedia content adaptation. In particular, it describes a method that allows decision-making (selecting the adaptation to perform) in situations where third-party pluggable multimedia conversion modules are involved and the multimedia adaptation planner does not know their exact adaptation capabilities. In this approach, the multimedia adaptation planner module is only responsible for a part of the required decisions; the pluggable modules make additional decisions based on different criteria. We demonstrate that partial decision-making is not only attainable, but also introduces advantages with respect to a system in which these conversion modules are not capable of providing additional decisions. This means that transferring decisions from the multi-step multimedia adaptation planner to the pluggable conversion modules increases the flexibility of the adaptation. Moreover, by allowing conversion modules to be only partially described, the range of problems that these modules can address increases, while significantly decreasing both the description length of the adaptation capabilities and the planning decision time. Finally, we specify the conditions under which knowing the partial adaptation capabilities of a set of conversion modules will be enough to compute a proper adaptation plan.",

Computational social choice has become a fundamental research area within AI and, in particular, in the area of multi-agent systems. While social choice has been a very flourishing area of research in economics and mathematics for a long time, only recently it has been recognised that its notions and techniques, if suitably adapted and embedded in a computational environment, can be extremely useful also in the context of multi-agent systems where a collection of agents needs to make collective decisions based on the individual preferences over the possible options. The special track at ISAIM 2014 showcased cutting edge results emphasizing the role payed by mathematics in computational social choice and was very successful in attracting top and well established researchers, as well as students. The success of the special track motivated us to dedicate this special issue to this area of research. The special issue contains extended versions of works presented at the symposium, as well as other relevant and original contributions to the field. The topics covered in this special issue are diverse and representative of the trends in the field: they range from complexity issues related to manipulation and bribery in voting rules to matching problems and hedonic games.",

            "paperAbstract": "The aim of general game playing (GGP) is to create intelligent agents that can automatically learn how to play many different games at an expert level without any human intervention. The traditional design model for GGP agents has been to use a minimax-based game-tree search augmented with an automatically learned heuristic evaluation function. The first successful GGP agents all followed that approach. In this paper, we describe CadiaPlayer, a GGP agent employing a radically different approach: instead of a traditional game-tree search, it uses Monte Carlo simulations for its move decisions. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate different simulation-based approaches on a wide variety of games, introduce a domain-independent enhancement for automatically learning search-control knowledge to guide the simulation playouts, and show how to adapt the simulation searches to be more effective in single-agent games. CadiaPlayer has already proven its effectiveness by winning the 2007 and 2008 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) GGP competitions.",

Intelligence, 31, 567-587] in which reaction time is measured is the result that IQ scores correlate better with longer (i.e., 0.7 and 0.9 quantile) reaction times than shorter (i.e., 0.1 and 0.3 quantile) reaction times. We show that this pattern of correlations can be predicted by the diffusion model [Ratcliff, R. (1978). A theory of memory retrieval. Psychological Review, 85, 59-108], in two ways: either assuming that the rate of accumulation of information toward a decision is higher for higher IQ subjects or assuming that the criterial amounts of information they require before a decision are lower. Importantly, the model explains both reaction times and accuracy, so the two possibilities can be distinguished.",

            "paperAbstract": "Players of real-time strategy (RTS) games are often annoyed by the inability of the game AI to select and move teams of units in a natural way. Units travel and battle separately, resulting in huge losses and the AI looking unintelligent, as can the choice of units sent to counteract the opponents. Players are affected as well as computer commanded factions because they cannot micromanage all team related issues. We suggest improving AI behavior by combining well-known computational intelligence techniques applied in an original way. Team composition for battling spatially distributed opponent groups is supported by a learning self-organizing map (SOM) that relies on an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to adapt it to the game. Different abilities of unit types are thus employed in a near-optimal way, reminiscent of human ad hoc decisions. Team movement is greatly enhanced by flocking and influence map-based path finding, leading to a more natural behavior by preserving individual motion types. The team decision to either attack or avoid a group of enemy units is easily parametrizable, incorporating team characteristics from fearful to daredevil. We demonstrate that these two approaches work well separately, but also that they go together naturally, thereby leading to an improved and flexible group behavior.",

            "paperAbstract": "The use of Neural Networks (NN) is necessary to bring the behavior of Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles (IAV) near the human one in recognition, learning, decision-making, and action. First, current navigation approaches based on NN are discussed. Indeed, these current approaches remedy insufficiencies of classical approaches related to real-time,autonomy , and intelligence. Second, a neural navigation approach essentially based on pattern classification to acquire target localization and obstacle avoidance behaviors is suggested. This approach must provide vehicles with capability, after supervised Gradient Backpropagation learning, to recognize both six (06) target location and thirty (30) obstacle avoidance situations using NN1 and NN2 classifiers, respectively. Afterwards, the decision-making and action consist of two association stages, carried out by reinforcement Trial and Error learning, and their coordination using a NN3. Then, NN3 allows to decide among five (05) actions (move towards 30\u00b0, move towards 60\u00b0, move towards 90\u00b0, move towards 120\u00b0, and move towards 150\u00b0). Third, simulation results which display the ability of theneural approach to provide IAV with capability to intelligently navigate in partially structured environments are presented. Finally, a discussion dealing with the suggested approach and how it relates to some other works is given.",

            "paperAbstract": "To ensure more autonomy and intelligence with real-time processing capabilities for the obstacle avoidance behavior of Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles (IAV), the use of soft computing is necessary to bring this behavior near to that of humans in the recognition, learning, adaptation, generalization, reasoning and decision-making, and action. In this paper, pattern classifiers of spatial obstacle avoidance situations using Neural Networks (NN), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) individually or in combination are suggested. These classifiers are based on supervised learning and adaptation paradigms as Gradient Back-Propagation (GBP), FL, GA and Simplified Fuzzy ArtMap (SFAM) resulting in NN/GBP and FL as Intelligent Systems (IS) and in NN/GA, NN/GA-GBP, NN-FL/GBP and NN-FL-ART/SFAM as Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS). Afterwards, a synthesis of the suggested pattern classifiers is presented where their results and performances are discussed as well as the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) architectures, characterized by their high flexibility and compactness, for their implementation.",

We present a utility-based framework for making repeated scheduling decisions based on dynamically observed information about unscheduled jobs and system\u2019s resources. This framework generalizes the standard scheduling problem to a resource-constrained environment, where resource allocation (RA) decisions (how many CPUs to allocate to each job) have to be made concurrently with the scheduling decisions (when to execute each job). Discrete-time Optimal Control theory is used to formulate the optimization problem of finding the scheduling/RA policy that maximizes the average utility per time step obtained from completed jobs. We propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) architecture for solving the NP-hard Optimal Control problem in real time, and our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the proposed approach.",

In fact, thanks to a description of their actions and control flow in some semiformal representation language, CGs can also take advantage of Computer Science methods and Information Technology infrastructures and techniques, to become executable documents, in the sense that they may support clinical decision making and clinical procedures execution. In order to reach this goal, some advanced planning techniques, originally developed within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community, may be (at least partially) resorted too, after a proper adaptation to the specific CG needs has been carried out.",

The creation and development of a support system using artificial intelligence algorithms provides new opportunities for investors in financial markets. Therefore, the authors have developed a support system that processes historical data, makes predictions using an ensemble of EVOLINO recurrent neural networks, assesses these predictions using a composition of high-low distributions, selects an orthogonal investment portfolio, and verifies the outcome on the real market. The support system requires multi-core hardware resources to allow for timely data processing using anMPI library-based parallel computation approach. A comparison of daily and weekly predictions reveals that weekly forecasts are less accurate than daily predictions, but are still accurate enough to trade successfully on the currency markets. Information obtained from the support system gives investors an advantage over uninformed market players in making investment decisions.",

            "paperAbstract": "This paper explores a model of choice and explanation in medical management and makes clear its advantages and limitations. The model is based on multiattribute decision making (MADM) and consists of four distinct strategies for choice and explanation, plus combinations of these four. Each strategy is a restricted form of the general MADM approach, and each makes restrictive assumptions about the nature of the domain. The advantage of tailoring a restricted form of a general technique to a particular domain is that such efforts may better capture the character of the domain and allow choice and explanation to be more naturally modelled. The uses of the strategies for both choice and explanation are illustrated with analyses of several existing medical management artificial intelligence (Al) systems, and also with examples from the management of primary breast cancer. Using the model it is possible to identify common underlying features of these Al systems, since each employs portions of this model in different ways. Thus the model enables better understanding and characterization of the seemingly ad hoc decision making of previous systems. Key words: artificial intelligence; expert systems; explanation; medical management. (Med Decis Making 7:22-31, 1987)",

The particular focus of our discussion is the investment domain - the goal of investment decision-making is to select an optimal portfolio that satisfies the investor's objective, or, in other words, to maximize the investment returns under the constraints given by investors. The investment domain contains numerous and diverse information sources, such as expert opinions, news releases and economic figures, and so on. This presents the potential for better decision support, but poses the challenge of building a decision support agent for accessing, filtering, evaluating, incorporating information from different sources, and for making final investment recommendations. We proposed a hybrid recommendation system that utilized two different artificial intelligence techniques to provide human user a decision recommendation on stock portfolio management.",

On the other hand, fuzzy ontologies can effectively solve data and knowledge with uncertainty, most importantly, if they are integrated with innovative methods for developing agents\u2019 intelligence as the Fuzzy Markup Language (FML). In this paper, an FML-based ontology-based intelligent fuzzy agent and a semantic decision making mechanism are proposed to apply to the semantic decision making for diabetes domain. The FML-based definition is considered modeling the knowledge base and rule base of the fuzzy objects and inference operators. The experimental results show that the proposed method is feasible for diabetes semantic decision-making.",

Nevertheless, the incorporation of domain knowledge and the application of adaptive decision making into such systems require extreme customization with a cost that becomes unaffordable, especially in the case of SMEs. We present an alternative approach for incorporating adaptive business intelligence into the company\u2019s backbone. We have designed and developed a highly reconfigurable, adaptive, cost efficient multi-agent framework that acts as an add-on to ERP software, employing Data Mining and Soft Computing techniques in order to provide intelligent recommendations on customer, supplier and inventory management.

Due to multiple objectives such as adaptive data rate, power control and quality-of-service, the message transmission becomes a non-deterministic polynomial computation time hard problem requiring cognitive processing. Thus a swarm algorithm that provides an optimal and reliable solution is applied. The low-cost, low-power hardware Bi-pulse-ultra-wideband is resilient to multipath fading, which occurs due to the wall-penetration, shadowing and propagation loss. The designed cross layer protocol incorporates the signal's physical properties. Hence, a cross layer protocol helps to balance the throughput while reducing latency, sensor resources thus longevity of network is attained.",

            "title": "Special Issue: Configuration",
            "paperAbstract": "Configuration can be defined as the composition of a complex product from instances of a set of component types, taking into account restrictions on the compatibility of those component types. For supporting product configuration, different artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are well established as central technologies in industrial configuration systems. However, the wide industrial use of configuration technologies and the increasing size and complexity of configuration problems make the field more challenging than ever. Today the mass customization paradigm has been extended from traditional physical products to the fields of software and service configuration. Configuration systems have evolved into interactive Web-based applications that need to support highly sophisticated knowledge representation and reasoning methods. A wide range of AI techniques are applied in this context: just to mention a few, constraint satisfaction, intelligent user interfaces, preference handling, and explanations. As a successful AI application area, configuration has attracted lasting industrial interest and renewed research, as demonstrated by a series of workshops on configuration that have been arranged in conjunction with leading AI conferences such as IJCAI, ECAI, and AAAI. The goal of this Special Issue on configuration is to demonstrate novel and innovative configuration research as well as new industrial applications of configuration technologies. The contributions of this Special Issue on configuration are a continuation of high-quality papers in previous special issues on configuration published in such journals as IEEE Intelligent Systems (1998), AI EDAM (1998 and 2003), and International Journal of Mass Customization (2010). The seven papers (five fulllength papers and two short papers) were selected from 17 submissions, which corresponds to a full-length paper acceptance rate of 29%. Each paper underwent two to four double-blind reviews by experts in the configuration domain. Papers with a positive reviewer feedback after the first review round were reviewed again to assure that all of the reviewer comments of the first round had been taken into account. The reviews of papers that included acoeditoras an author were managed in a screened manner by uninvolved coeditors or members of the Special Issue program committee. The major topics of the current Special Issue include personalization techniques and algorithms in knowledge-based configuration, different issues of configuration knowledge representation, industrial configuration environments and new application domains, and business-oriented aspects of the application of configuration technologies. \u201cModeling and Solving Technical Product Configuration Problems\u201d by Andreas Falkner, Alois Haselboeck, Gottfried Schenner, and Herwig Schreiner contains an introduction to the \u201cpartner units\u201d problem and provides a discussion of possible alternative knowledge representation approaches (e.g., Unified Modeling Language/Object Constraint Language and Alloy). In addition, the paper contains a discussion of possible approaches to solve the \u201cpartner units\u201d problem (from basic backtracking to local search approaches such as \u201csimulated annealing\u201d). The paper is concluded with an in-depth analysis of the applied search algorithms. In their short paper on \u201cProduct Configuration as Decision Support: The Declarative Paradigm in Practice\u201d Albert Haag and Steffen Riemann discuss knowledge representation issues in the SAP configuration environment. As an application domain for configuration technologies they introduce the customization of SAP systems. Besides the discussion of the advantages and trade-offs of procedural and declarative knowledge representations, the authors provide an in-depth discussion of the application of assumption-based truth maintenance approaches in their configuration environment. \u201cA Declarative Framework for Work Process Configuration,\u201d written by Wolfgang Mayer, Markus Stumptner, Peter Killisperger, and Georg Grossmann, extends established constraint-based configuration approaches with a constraint representation language for representing specific properties of execution paths in work processes. In this context, a framework for semiautomated process customization is introduced. It integrates the extended constraint approach with a metamodel of work processes. Valid process configurations are then semiautomatically built on the basis of heuristic search.

            "paperAbstract": "High-speed, accuracy, meticulousness and quick responses are the notion of the vital necessities for modern digital world. An efficient electronic circuit unswervingly affects the maneuver of the whole system. Different tools are required to unravel different types of engineering tribulations. Improving the efficiency, accuracy and low power consumption in an electronic circuit is always been a bottle neck problem. So the need of circuit miniaturization is always there. It saves a lot of time and power while switching of gates and reduces the wiring-crises. Therefore to trounce with this problem we have proposed an artificial intelligence (AI) based approach that makes use of Rough Set Theory for its implementation. Theory of rough set has been proposed by Z Pawlak in the year 1982. Rough set theory is a new mathematical tool which deals with uncertainty and vagueness. Decisions can be generated using rough set theory by reducing the unwanted and superfluous data. We have condensed the number of gates without upsetting the productivity of the given circuit. This paper proposes an approach using artificial intelligence technique with the help of rough set theory which basically lessens the number of gates in the circuit, based on decision rules.",

The growth of social media has allowed people to express their emotion publicly in an unprecedented manner. Textual content and user linkages fostered by social media networks can be used to examine emotion types, intensity, and contagion. However, research into how emotion evolves and entrains in social media that influence security issues is scarce. In this research, we developed an approach to analyzing emotion expressed in political social media. We compared two methods of emotion analysis to identify influential users and to trace their contagion effects on public emotion, and report preliminary findings of analyzing the emotion of 105,304 users who posted 189,012 tweets on the U.S. immigration and border security issues in November 2014. The results provide strong implication for understanding social actions and for collecting social intelligence for security informatics. This research should contribute to helping decision makers and security personnel to use public emotion effectively to develop appropriate strategies.",

            "paperAbstract": "Focal points refer to prominent solutions of an interaction, solutions to which agents are drawn. This paper considers how automated agents could use focal points for coordination in communication\u2010impoverished situations. Coordination is a central theme of Distributed Artificial Intelligence. Much work in this field can be seen as a search for mechanisms that allow agents with differing knowledge and goals to coordinate their actions for mutual benefit. Additionally, one of the main assumptions of the field is that communication is expensive relative to computation. Thus, coordination techniques that minimize communication are of particular importance. Our purpose in this paper is to consider how to model the process of finding focal points from domain\u2010independent criteria, under the assumption that agents cannot communicate with one another. We consider two alternative approaches for finding focal points, one based on decision theory, the second on step\u2010logic. The first provides for a more natural integration of agent utilities, while the second more successfully models the difficulty of finding solutions. For both cases, we present simulations over randomly generated domains that suggest that focal points can act as an effective heuristic for coordination.",

Many important artificial intelligence problems (planning, nonmonotonic reasoning, formal verification, etc.) can be reduced to QBFs. A new DLL-based method is proposed that integrates binary decision diagram (BDD) to set free the variable ordering heuristics that are traditionally constrained by the static order of the QBF quantifiers. BDD is used to represent in a compact form the set of models of the Boolean formula. Interesting reduction operators are proposed in order to dynamically reduce the BDD size and to answer the validity of the QBF. Experimental results on instances from the QBF'03 evaluation show that our approach can efficiently solve instances that are very hard for current QBF solvers.",

            "paperAbstract": "Medical decision\u2013related numeracy includes aptitude with numbers, fractions, and ratios. It is an aptitude assumed necessary for complete understanding of the risks of health behaviors and medical treatments, for communicating one\u2019s utilities when the patient\u2019s individual preferences can swing the decision, and for considering costs and cost-effectiveness of alternative treatments. The ability to perform basic arithmetic operations is part, but not all, of health numeracy. It has been established that patients\u2019 health literacy (the ability to read information relevant to health) is related to their health behaviors and health outcomes. We would also expect numeracy to be associated with health outcomes, although there is little evidence yet of its connection to health outcomes that could not be explained as an expression of the effects of health literacy or of general intelligence. It seems reasonable to figure out how physicians and health communicators may compensate for patients\u2019 numeracy deficits by communicating in a way so that they may understand quantitative concepts. In this endeavor, should physicians and health educators routinely assess patients\u2019 health literacy and numeracy and adjust their communication contingent on their patients\u2019 ability to understand? Or should they develop a message that all patients can grasp and use it universally? Articles in this issue of Medical Decision Making provide support for each of these competing approaches. Fagerlin, ZikmundFisher, and colleagues report on the development of a subjective measure of numeracy intended to facilitate its measurement for research. Presumably, an instrument such as this could serve as a basis for sorting patients into groups to receive messages appropriate for different levels of health literacy and numeracy. Schwartz, Woloshin, and Welch, on the other hand, describe a communication tool, a \u2018\u2018Drug Facts Box,\u2019\u2019 that tabulates the efficacy and side effect rates of a treatment. This tool successfully conveyed its key concepts not only to the well educated (health lecture attendees in a university town) but also to the poorly educated (patients and family members in a Veterans Affairs medical center waiting room). Although the tool is proposed as a required component of direct-to-consumer advertisements rather than for patient education, it represents an ideal of communication, accessible for all, that does not oversimplify but rather expresses the concepts essential for evaluating a treatment decision, including the numerical aspects of risk, efficacy, and quality of life.",

The particular focus of our discussion is the investment domain - the goal of investment decision-making is to select an optimal portfolio that satisfies the investor's objective, or, in other words, to maximize the investment returns under the constraints given by investors. The investment domain contains numerous and diverse information sources, such as expert opinions, news releases and economic figures, and so on. This presents the potential for better decision support, but poses the challenge of building a decision support agent for accessing, filtering, evaluating, incorporating information from different sources, and for making final investment recommendations. We proposed a hybrid recommendation system that utilized two different artificial intelligence techniques to provide human user a decision recommendation on stock portfolio management.",

            "paperAbstract": "Over the past two decades, financial market crises with similar features have occurred in different regions of the world. Unstable cross-market linkages during financial crises are referred to as financial contagion. We simulate the transmission of financial crises in the context of a model of market participants adopting various strategies; this allows testing for financial contagion under alternative scenarios. Using a comprehensive approach, we develop an agent-based multinational model and identify factors contributing to contagion. Although contagion has been investigated in the financial literature, it has not yet been studied extensively through computational intelligence techniques. The first steps in that direction are taken in [1],[2],[3],[4]. We extend these studies and introduce GARCH model and Clayton copula to better capture markets interdependence and to improve the evolutionary optimization technique. Our model further comprises four rather than three types of traders: technical, game, herd, and noise traders, respectively. The different types of traders use different strategies to make now three rather than two kinds of decisions: \u201cbuy\u201d, \u201csell\u201d, or \u201dhold\u201d. Our simulations shed light on parameter values and characteristics which can be exploited in further research to detect contagion at an earlier stage, hence recognizing financial crises with the potential to destabilize cross-market linkages.",

It is of great concern on the ways to find the hidden rules of information in the mass of data. Given the background above, this paper explores the methods of data mining by using the combination of Decision tree algorithm and Clustering algorithm. In addition, this paper accomplishes stock forecasting by combining CART algorithm and DBSCAN algorithm to build a predictive model with good applicability through a large number of experiments for parameter testing. According to the works above, the predictive model has a high accuracy and provides a scientific theory supporting the investment decisions.",

Its ability to utilize noisy and missing data makes it a good candidate to study biological systems. In this paper we propose the use of Bayesian network approach to study cellular response of cyanobacteria. We discuss how to combine individual gene expressions, obtained from microarrays generated using different platforms, to get biological process level behaviors. Biological processes carry more information towards understanding overall cell behavior. We then discuss several approaches available for identifying the structure of a Bayesian network and derive corresponding system level regulatory network for cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. We discuss a method to quantify the strengths of the associations between different processes. The resultant network is used to simulate some of the experimental conditions and the responses of the network under those conditions are inferred. We show that these inferences agree with the observations made in the original experiments. Finally, we discuss how these type of networks could be helpful in making decisions on controlling the cellular activities so that the desired behaviors are achieved.",

The growth of social media has allowed people to express their emotion publicly in an unprecedented manner. Textual content and user linkages fostered by social media networks can be used to examine emotion types, intensity, and contagion. However, research into how emotion evolves and entrains in social media that influence security issues is scarce. In this research, we developed an approach to analyzing emotion expressed in political social media. We compared two methods of emotion analysis to identify influential users and to trace their contagion effects on public emotion, and report preliminary findings of analyzing the emotion of 105,304 users who posted 189,012 tweets on the U.S. immigration and border security issues in November 2014. The results provide strong implication for understanding social actions and for collecting social intelligence for security informatics. This research should contribute to helping decision makers and security personnel to use public emotion effectively to develop appropriate strategies.",

            "paperAbstract": "One of the major problems in the implementation of the precautionary principle in environmental cases is the estimation of the weight of evidence. In this paper we propose a formal method that determines the weight of evidence based on the specific parameters of a given case. The proposed method is based on an artificial intelligence approach called fuzzy logic, which is commonly used as an interface between logic and human perception, and often applied to computer-based complex decision making. We use one fuzzy expert system that provides a quantification of the estimated environmental damage, and a second fuzzy expert system that computes the weight of evidence in a given case. The proposed expert system can be easily defined and adjusted by regulators and environmental science and policy experts.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract The problem of designing \u201cintelligent machines\u201d operating in uncertain environments with minimum supervision or interaction with a human operator is examined. The structure of an \u201cintelligent machine\u201d is defined to be the structure of a Hierarchically Intelligent Control System, composed of three levels hierarchically ordered according to the principle of \u201cincreasing precision with decreasing intelligence\u201d, namely: the organizational level, performing general information processing tasks in association with a long-term memory, the coordination level, dealing with specific information processing tasks with a short-term memory, and the control level, which performs the execution of various tasks through hardware using feedback control methods. The behavior of such a machine may be managed by controls with special considerations and its \u201cintelligence\u201d is directly related to the derivation of a compatible measure that associates the intelligence of the higher levels with the concept of entropy, which is a sufficient analytic measure that unifies the treatment of all the levels of an \u201cintelligent machine\u201d as the mathematical problem of finding the right sequence of internal decisions and controls for a system structured in the order of intelligence and inverse order of precision such that it minimizes its total entropy. A case study on the automatic maintenance of a nuclear plant illustrates the proposed approach.",

            "paperAbstract": "Object identification and tracking applications of pattern recognition at video rates is a problem of wide interest, with previous attempts limited to very simple threshold or correlation (restricted window) methods. New high-speed algorithms together with fast digital hardware have produced a system for missile and aircraft identification and tracking that possesses a degree of ``intelligence'' not previously implemented in a real-time tracking system. Adaptive statistical clustering and projection-based classification algorithms are applied in real time to identify and track objects that change in appearance through complex and nonstationary background/foreground situations. Fast estimation and prediction algorithms combine linear and quadratic estimators to provide speed and sensitivity. Weights are determined to provide a measure of confidence in the data and resulting decisions. Strategies based on maximizing the probability of maintaining track are developed. This paper emphasizes the theoretical aspects of the system and discusses the techniques used to achieve real-time implementation.",

            "title": "Computational design synthesis",
            "paperAbstract": "Nearly every human society has been fundamentally altered by computers in the last 30 years. We rely on servers, desktops, and handheld devices to facilitate duties of both our personal and professional lives. Most of this is just managing data: input, store, transfer, output. There is also analysis: given a set of inputs, solve for x. For engineers, x is a prediction of how hot, how much stress, how much efficiency, or how much cost. However, other than the use of computers to manage data or perform analysis, there is a third use of computation that is rarely perceived by the average computer user or engineer, and that is the use of computers in design synthesis. As our engineering artifacts grow in complexity, we need to offload some design decisions to the computer. We need the computer to help us synthesize many of the minute details in our engineering devices as well as ensure high performance by searching among a myriad of alternatives for the optimal combination of building blocks and parameter values. Computational design synthesis (CDS) is a research area focused on approaches to automating synthesis activities in design. Resulting methods may be fully automated or interactive with the goals of automatically generating a range of alternatives, sparking creativity and innovation, automating tedious or time-consuming engineering tasks, and simply exploring the creative abilities of computational systems. There is a fuzzy line between CDS and applied optimization. We have intended CDS to be more ambitious than the typical use of optimization to \u201csolve for x.\u201d It is intended to mimic what humans consider in design, not only parameters, like in a fixed vector, x, but also material choices, discrete component choices, and the basic architecture of building blocks. Such research is typically ambitious in scope, demanding in terms of developmental and computational resources, and extensive in terms of related work. The work is based on artificial intelligence, mathematical programming, computational geometry, graph theory, engineering design theory, and cognitive science. When applied later in the design process, meaningful results are only achievable by interfacing with the computational analysis tools that govern our engineering world, such as those for solving partial-differential field equations (e.g., finite element analysis or computational fluid dynamics) or those for solving ordinary-differential equations (e.g., three-dimensional dynamics). In addition to the technical challenge, it can be difficult to interface with these tools because many are expensive, deal with proprietary file formats, and are sometimes operable only within the tool\u2019s graphical user interface. Combine this with highly iterative optimization methods (many design synthesis techniques require the use of large stochastic optimization methods), and researchers may occasionally find themselves up against practical limits in computational time and memory. Early in the design process, CDS has faced issues of how to represent and reason with nebulous notions of function and feasibility as well as methods of predicting performance when various parameters are undefined. In the first paper, \u201cEvaluating FuncSION: A Software for Automated Synthesis of Design Solutions for Stimulating Ideation During Mechanical Conceptual Design,\u201d Ujjwal Pal, Ying Chieh Liu, and Amaresh Chakrabarti address this problem directly by synthesizing transformations (without the need for detailed part definition) to the problem of converting energy from one distinct location to another. It is a classic example of a body of work that has grown steadily over the last three decades. It is our opinion, and likely the opinion of the paper\u2019s authors, that this work must someday positively affect the design of electromechanical systems. CDS has also championed the use of generative design grammars as a means to simultaneously provide structure and design freedom during synthesis. A generative grammar is composed of rules that, unlike the traditional definition of rules, focus on defining the actions or design transformations and modifications that can be performed. Just like human languages (e.g., English, German, or Chinese), formal grammars require a vocabulary of terms that can take the form of strings, parameters, graphs, or shapes, which can also be represented by graphs. Unlike an expert system, the grammar rules are more about capturing design logic concisely than about Reprint requests to: Matthew I.

This requires a normalization of the values, to allow their meaningful comparison and aggregation over networks with different sizes and orders. The concrete choices of such preprocessing steps like normalization and aggregation are almost never discussed in network analytic papers. In this paper, we show that even sticking to the most simple centrality index (the degree) but using different, classic choices of normalization and aggregation strategies, can turn a node from being among the most central to being among the least central. We present our results by using an aggregation operator which scales between different, classic aggregation strategies based on three multiplex networks. We also introduce a new visualization and characterization of a node's sensitivity to the choice of a normalization and aggregation strategy in multiplex networks. The observed high sensitivity of single nodes to the specific choice of aggregation and normalization strategies is of strong importance, especially for all kinds of intelligence-analytic software as it questions the interpretations of the findings.",

            "paperAbstract": "The budget-allocation process in pavement management occurs at several levels of decision making. In normal practice, the central level is concerned with the allocation of the budget to regional agencies to improve the health of the overall road network, while the regions are responsible for the programming and scheduling of road maintenance in their respective networks. The information processed at different management levels differs, and information at one level may not be readily available to the other. As a result, the maintenance funds allocated by central management to regional highway agencies may not be best used. A budgetallocation procedure based on artificial-intelligence agents is presented; it takes into account information integration between the central and regional management levels by using multiagent systems. Agents are used to facilitate the interaction between decision makers at the two management levels and thus provide a means for vertical information integration. A hypothetical problem containing a two-level funds-allocation structure consisting of a central-level management and three regional highway agencies is investigated. Each regional agency has different road network profiles with different local-level objectives. A genetic algorithm is used as the optimization tool in the decision-making process carried out by each agent. The results are compared with conventional allocation approaches and a two-stage optimization approach. It is shown that, with better integration of information at the different management levels, the resulting budget-allocation strategy produces greater maintenance-cost savings for a given target level of pavement performance.",

The basic idea is to combine the hardware and software design cycles. This article shows how knowledge-based techniques can be used to solve the hardware-software partitioning problem, the co-design task that makes the decision on the best implementation of the different components of a digital system. In particular, a fuzzy-logic-based expert system, SHAPES, has been developed based on the CommonKADS methodology. This tool takes advantage of two important artificial intelligence bases: the use of an expert's knowledge in the decision-making process and the possibility of dealing with imprecise and usually uncertain values by the definition of fuzzy magnitudes.Expert system construction has adopted a knowledge modeling approach, following the knowledge level and knowledge separation principles. This expertise model is the center of the knowledge-based system development. It is based in the problem-solving method Propose and Revise with a previous heuristic classification.",

            "title": "A full first-order constraint solver for decomposable theories",
            "paperAbstract": "Over the last decade, first-order constraints have been efficiently used in the artificial intelligence world to model many kinds of complex problems such as: scheduling, resource allocation, computer graphics and bio-informatics. Recently, a new property called decomposability has been introduced and many first-order theories have been proved to be decomposable: finite or infinite trees, rational and real numbers, linear dense order,...etc. A decision procedure in the form of five rewriting rules has also been developed. This latter can decide if a first-order formula without free variables is true or not in any decomposable theory. Unfortunately, this decision procedure is not enough when we want to express the solutions of a first-order constraint having free variables. These kind of problems are generally known as first-order constraint satisfaction problems. We present in this paper, not only a decision procedure but a full first-order constraint solver for decomposable theories. Our solver is given in the form of nine rewriting rules which transform any first-order constraint \u03d5 (which can possibly contain free variables) into an equivalent formula \u03c6 which is either the formula true, or the formula false or a simple solved formula having at least one free variable and being equivalent neither to true nor to false. We show the efficiency of our solver by solving complex first-order constraints over finite or infinite trees containing a huge number of imbricated quantifiers and negations and compare the performances with those obtained using the most recent and efficient dedicated solver for finite or infinite trees. This is the first full first-order constraint solver for any decomposable theory.",

One solution is using a warning component implemented at the server- and locally. It is presented the need of alarms (as logical combinations of threshold levels for the values read from the sensors at the local level), the approach to define and implement these in the server, and the communication of the alarm scenarios to the local computers using Web Services. Further ways to improve the ?intelligent? functionalities of the system are briefly analyzed: intelligent processing of medical signals acquired (ECGs), movement and behavior analysis, context-based communication facilities, decision support, data mining functions at central level.",

New high-speed algorithms together with fast digital hardware have produced a system for missile and aircraft identification and tracking that possesses a degree of ``intelligence'' not previously implemented in a real-time tracking system. Adaptive statistical clustering and projection-based classification algorithms are applied in real time to identify and track objects that change in appearance through complex and nonstationary background/foreground situations. Fast estimation and prediction algorithms combine linear and quadratic estimators to provide speed and sensitivity. Weights are determined to provide a measure of confidence in the data and resulting decisions. Strategies based on maximizing the probability of maintaining track are developed. This paper emphasizes the theoretical aspects of the system and discusses the techniques used to achieve real-time implementation.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract\nThe increasing reliance on Computational Intelligence techniques like Artificial Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms to formulate trading decisions have sparked off a chain of research into financial forecasting and trading trend identifications. Many research efforts focused on enhancing predictive capability and identifying turning points. Few actually presented empirical results using live data and actual technical trading rules. This paper proposed a novel RSPOP Intelligent Stock Trading System, that combines the superior predictive capability of RSPOP FNN and the use of widely accepted Moving Average and Relative Strength Indicator Trading Rules. The system is demonstrated empirically using real live stock data to achieve significantly higher Multiplicative Returns than a conventional technical rule trading system. It is able to outperform the buy-and-hold strategy and generate several folds of dollar returns over an investment horizon of four years. The Percentage of Winning Trades was increased significantly from an average of 70% to more than 92% using the system as compared to the conventional trading system; demonstrating the system\u2019s ability to filter out erroneous trading signals generated by technical rules and to preempt any losing trades. The system is designed based on the premise that it is possible to capitalize on the swings in a stock counter\u2019s price, without a need for predicting target prices.\n",

            "title": "Special Issue: Design Rationale",
            "paperAbstract": "The process of designing can be viewed as making a series of design decisions. These decisions, the alternatives considered, the reasons for and against the decisions, and the dependencies among all of these form the rationale for the design. This design rationale provides a history of the design process as well as capturing the intent behind the decisions made. Design rationale has been an active area of research since the 1970s with the introduction of issue-based information systems (IBIS) as a means for representing argumentation-based rationale (Kunz & Rittel, 1970). Rationale research has been applied to many design disciplines including engineering design (Lee, 1997), human\u2013computer interaction (Moran & Carroll, 1996), and software engineering (Dutoit et al., 2006)(Burge et al., 2008). Despite over 30 years of research, there are still few rationale systems used in practice. There is a strong consensus that rationale is very valuable, but there is an equally strong concern that the costs of its capture may be too high. In order to justify the costs of its capture, it is essential to establish ways in which rationale can be useful that exceed the simple provision of additional design documentation. The seven articles in this Special Issue address the usefulness of rationale. One article points out how much is still unknown about both the cost of capturing the rationale and how it can be most useful. It concludes that successful technology transfer cannot occur until more is known about where rationale is really needed and how well current approaches meet those needs. The remaining articles describe research into the uses of rationale that include capturing and maintaining design constraints, understanding existing designs, supporting design research, providing traceability for customer needs during the early design stage, capturing knowledge generated during building redesign, and supporting the reuse of highlevel software designs. These articles describe a wide spectrum of design rationale uses and methodologies in multiple domains and at multiple levels of formality. \u201cResearching Under Uncertainty,\u201d by Burge, describes the controversy over the usefulness of rationale versus the potential cost of its collection. The arguments both for and against rationale are presented along with a list of rationale approaches and how they were evaluated. Although there has been significant research activity proposing rationale approaches over the last 30 years, little data on the actual use and usefulness of rationale have been collected. The article also presents the results of a survey of software practitioners and their predictions of how rationale could be used. The results of this survey appear counterintuitive and indicate the need for more emphasis on gathering and reporting data on the uses for rationale and its usefulness. \u201cConstraint Capture and Maintenance in Engineering Design,\u201d by Ajit, Sleeman, Fowler, and Knott, tackles the important task of ensuring that designs are consistent with their specification and design rules defined by the organization developing the design. The relationship of the design rules to the problem can be defined as constraints. It is necessary to capture these constraints and to understand the conditions (assumptions and context) under which a constraint applies. These conditions form part of the rationale for the constraint. The methodology that is described supports constraint maintenance by detecting inconsistencies, subsumption, and redundancy as well as performing fusion between constraints and assisting with constraint refinement. \u201cHow to Evaluate Reading and Interpretation of Differently Structured Engineering Design Rationales,\u201d by Aurisicchio, Gourtovaia, Bracewell, and Wallace, describes an empirical study on reading and interpreting technical documentation that is provided to aerospace trainees in a structured text format provided by DRed (using IBIS-style argumentation) and as unstructured text design definition reports. The article provides the results of this evaluation as well as a methodology for similar empirical tool evaluations. The experiment participants were provided with information in one of the two formats and asked a series of questions about it. The results indicate that the more structured DRed format has a positive impact on both the answers to the questions and the time required. Reprint requests to: Janet E.

The authors surveyed all NLM-funded trainees at the nine sites supported in the spring of 1988 to determine their backgrounds, current research interests, and career plans. Forty-three fellows were identified, of whom 39 returned a mailed questionnaire. All but four were physicians (89.7%), 82.1 % had at least one year of postdoctoral clinical training, and 61.5% had completed a residency. Seventy- one percent of those completing residency had done so in internal medicine. The most common areas of current research were decision support/decision analysis, knowledge representation, and artificial intelligence. The overwhelming majority of the fellows planned to seek positions in a medical school on completion of their fellowships, and most preferred affiliation with a de partment of medical informatics or medicine.

This paper describes an agent-based simulation model for analyzing corporate behaviors of competing firms. The simulator employs evolutionary computation to evolve the characteristics of the firms. This paper also addresses a novel technology of agent-based modeling with genetic algorithms. Our method is characterized by (1) decision making agents or competing companies with strategic parameters to be optimized; (2) a multiobjective optimisation framework to evolve the artificial simulated society; (3) grounding the simulation conditions with marketing survey data in the real world, and (4) validating the strategic parameters of the agents after simulation via statistical analysis of the individual genes. The proposed method enables us to investigate the strategic measures or balanced scoreboards of competing companies from the agents' actions in the simulator.",

By integrating the 25 agents in a multi-agent system, we were able to obtain much better results (according to the return and maximum drawdown metrics); this leads us to believe that it might be possible to use one such system in the creation of a profitable hedge fund in which the investment decisions can be made without human intervention.",

Ranging from simple games such as Space Invaders to modern complex first person shooters (FPSs), artificial and computational intelligence techniques have been widely exploited to design and develop virtual characters behaviors in order to provide them with a high degree of human-likeness. Our work tries to improve current bots' human-likeness by introducing an abstract collection of artificial components capable of synthetizing cognitive processes that usually allow intelligent natural entities to take autonomous decisions by dynamically analyzing environmental stimuli, emotions, personality and physical conditions. In particular, our proposal exploits some theories from psychological research area and introduces a novel kinds of fuzzy controllers, named Timed Automata based Fuzzy Controllers, in order to provide Non Player Characters with a more realistic and efficient behaviors.",

            "title": "Towards an Adaptive Approach for Distributed Resource Allocation in a Multi-agent System for Solving Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problems",
            "paperAbstract": "Introduction. The existing problem of continuous planning in transportation logistics requires the solving of dynamic Vehicle Routing Problems (dynamic VRPs) which is an NP-complete optimization problem. The task of continuous planning assumes the existence of individual commit times for orders to be released for execution with specific commitment strategies and is similar to the problem of maintaining a guaranteed response time in real-time systems that, in a dynamic environment, applies additional restrictions on planning algorithms. This paper describes the developed multi-agent platform for solving the dynamic multi-vehicle pickup and delivery problem with soft time windows (dynamic m-PDPSTW) that supports goaldriven behavior of autonomous agents with a multi-objective decision-making model. Further research on the design of adaptive mechanisms for run-time feedback-directed adjustment of scheduling algorithms through learning and experience of applied decision options is outlined. The market-based method for distributed dynamic resource allocation. The authors\u2019 multi-agent approach to continuous planning in complex uncertain environments implements the concept of the dynamic distributed resource allocation (Modi et al. 2002) whereby decision making is carried out by means of asynchronous quasi-parallel processes of negotiation between the agents of resources and the agents of orders which are working distributively in a virtual marketplace over all the agents of the complex shared ontology object. Goal-driven behavior of autonomous agents is supported by the developed multiobjective decision-making model based on individual goals, criteria, and preference functions defined in the virtual marketplace ontology and methods of agent self-appraisal and decision-making strategies (priority of criteria, value superposition, and homeostasis). In the implemented framework for agent knowledge representation, based on Prof. Marvin Minsky\u2019s concept of frames, each autonomous agent in the virtual marketplace has its individual knowledge, agent memory with a dynamic decision-making table, experience of applied deciCopyright \u00a9 2007, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. sion options, and reality representation of the world model (a shared ontological scene of reality) in an individual ontological scene and has its own perception via sensors and facades (Chevelev et al. 2006). The presented process of self-organization in such a multi-agent system is based on the constant search to maintain a dynamic balance among the interests of all participants in the interaction by means of an economically decentralized method of agent behavioral coordination. The microeconomic model defines violation functions of agent preferences with personal accounts for agents and reflects individual expenses and profits for all agents at any moment of distributed decision-making process. Furthermore, this microeconomic model provides the basis for decentralized mechanisms for controlling emergent behavior and stabilizing of agent swarms. Control methods of self-organization in complex environments. Conducted experiments on agent microeconomic parameters demonstrates that the complex system of interacting autonomous agents is characterized by the opportunity of the existence of several stable equilibria (attractors), by the unpredictable nonlinear processes of transitions between them, and by the emergence of resonating and oscillatory properties in the system. Special attention was given to the simulated processes of the significant internal reconfiguration of the agent system in response to the smallest external signals (a catastrophe) \u2013 trifling alterations on the agent local level led to a large-scale schedule reconstruction. Effective control mechanisms for selforganization need to be developed to make multi-agent systems more effective in solving dynamic VRPs with a view to achieving practical levels of performance for continuous planning in complex environments with higher levels of uncertainty, such as multi-modal logistics with multiple, competing companies. The developed mechanisms provide control methods for achieving both of the contending objectives: the transition of the multi-agent system toward the global quasi-optimal state while avoiding undesirable local attractors and the stabilization of agent activity and limitation of schedule reconstruction for maintaining a guaranteed response time for orders to be scheduled and released for execution according to their individual commitment times.",

            "title": "Design pedagogy: Representations and processes",
            "paperAbstract": "This Special Issue of AI EDAM is devoted to research on design pedagogy. In particular, the papers focus on the ways that explicit representations of design knowledge can influence the ways we teach design. The papers use a variety of research approaches and span many areas of design including engineering and architecture, but they all share a concern both for the design process and the practical concerns of design educators in the classroom and in the studio. Design pedagogy raises significant challenges for researchers in design theory, methodology, and artificial intelligence. When people learn engineering design or seek to improve their skill as designers, both the teacher and the student must actively structure their knowledge. The teacher seeks to formalize and structure a body of knowledge gained from design experience. The student is challenged to observe design processes (their own and those of colleagues and teachers). Based on their observations they form hypotheses and test them through projects. The best design processes that emerge from these cycles of practice and reflection must be both effective and teachable. Many design methods have been proposed with great ambitions to improve professional practice. If the improvements do not materialize, which happens all too often, it frequently turns out that the method is not well understood by those seeking to apply it or that the method is not being applied as intended by its developers. It is not an exaggeration to say that a process that cannot be learned or implemented by the majority of designers is a method that cannot succeed in practice. For these reasons, an appreciation of knowledge representation and pedagogy could be a key to better design outcomes. The first three papers seek to link ongoing design instruction to quantitative research. In \u201cThe Design Studio \u201cCrit\u201d: Teacher\u2013Student Communication,\u201d the architecture studios at the Technion were in effect used as a research setting. The interactions among students and teachers were recorded. Coding of verbalizations and linkography were used to provide insights into the differences among students and teachers and the various styles of feedback in the studio. Similarly, in \u201cA Study of the Role of User-Centered Design Methods in Design Team Projects,\u201d the design courses at MIT were employed as a source of data. During the design projects, the frequency and duration of interactions with users were recorded. The design outcomes were not a function of the amount of user interactions but appear to be related to their timing. Late in the design process, when design knowledge is most richly represented via prototypes, users can provide a significantly different sort of input to the process than is possible earlier in the process. Thus, in the first two papers, quantitative observations of educational activities give rise to practical advice for design educators. A different approach is taken in \u201cA Course for Teaching Design Research Methodology\u201d; the course is not an object of design research, but rather a means to convey design research methodology. It is interesting to consider how such a course might have affected the other papers in the Special Issue. The next two papers seek to draw upon concepts and methods in social sciences to advance design pedagogy. In the field of cognitive psychology, decision-making heuristics have long been studied as a cause of systematic errors. More recently, heuristics have been analyzed as a strategy for simplifying problem representation that can be effective in realistic contexts. In this second vein, \u201cCognitive Heuristics in Design: Instructional Strategies to Increase Creativity in Idea Generation\u201d provides evidence that design heuristics can help students generate a greater variety of solutions and solutions that are judged to be more creative. Methods for semistructured interviewing and analysis of the resulting narratives are also emerging from the social sciences. Although other techniques, such as protocol analysis, seek to reduce the influence of subjective experience on the results, some studies now focus on the individual\u2019s perceptions as the primary object of study. The views of 19 experienced design educators are studied in \u201cScrutinizing Design Educators\u2019 Perceptions of Design Process.\u201d The resulting impression is that experienced designers quickly shift among many representations and processes as they \u201cpick and mix\u201d as the circumstances seem to dictate.

            "paperAbstract": "All throughout history people have had the sense that products become more complex by incorporating new features or new technologies. Up to the middle of the 20th century, most products remained sufficiently simple that single people could design them. Now, all but the simplest products are designed by teams of people with different skills and expertise. Modern products span a range of traditional engineering disciplines incorporating mechanical and electrical elements as well as software to control them. Many of the products that we now think of as complex products, such as aircraft, cars, or trains, started off as mechanical systems, but now require a similar, if not greater, effort in the development of the electronic and software systems. Their 20th-century predecessors were designed to withstand many situations by overdesigning many parts of the systems, while other parts of the system needed to be replaced frequently. To minimize risk associated with products as well as product and design costs, companies reuse as many subsystems or components as they can, so that all products are a mixture of old and new elements. Modern products are to a much larger extent optimized and customized for particular uses, while overall being far more reliable during their intended life span. The products are now designed together with the service and maintenance processes that support them and assure their safety during the product life cycle. This integration of services with products has reached a point that many companies are now selling capabilities, rather than products, keeping the product in the company over its life span. All of these issues need be considered from the beginning of the product development process, as early decisions lock the product and service development in and determine many of the costs over the product life cycle. This had let to an increasing interest in system architecture design in many companies. System architecture determines the \u201carrangement of the functional elements into physical blocks\u201d (Ulrich & Eppinger, 1995). This involves the arrangement of functional elements, the mapping from functional elements to physical components, and the specification of the interfaces among interacting physical components (Ulrich & Eppinger, 1995) as well as the interface surrounding context (Crawley, 2007). The system architecture requires an understanding of the product in its entirety and across its life cycle, and its use at a time in the process when many requirements and constraints are still unknown. This involves many trade-off decisions between conflicting constraints and requirements, as different solution principles within the system on many levels of detail. System architecture is at the same time subject to this uncertainty but also determines, through the decisions that are being taken, which uncertainties affect the product. When products were simpler, individual engineers retained an overview of the entire product (see Flanagan et al., 2007), and they were able to carry out fundamental trade-offs between different parts of the system in their minds. Many highly complex products have now reached such a level of complexity and multidisciplinarity that very few engineers have the breadth of knowledge to have an even cursory understanding of the product and its life cycle in its entirety. Companies are therefore demanding from the academic community both the training of general design experts who can support the early phases of design processes and tools to support the experts in the system architecture phase. This Special Issue is responding to this demand, by attempting to bring together some of the current thinking and research on system architecture design. The research on system architecture design is dispersed across multiple communities. The interest in the design and product development community in idea generation and early phases of design has grown into addressing system architecture of complex products at the point where fundamental decisions are being made (e.g., Wyatt et al., 2012). New system architectures are rarely designed from scratch. Many inherit the system architecture from a predecessor, so that the architectures can be remarkably similar over generations of products even if the functional requirements that led to the original architecture no longer exist. The reuse of components or subsystems also leads to a persistence of the architecture, both the overall architecture and the architecture of subsysReprint requests to: Claudia Eckert, Department of Engineering and Innovation, Open University, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, UK.

            "paperAbstract": "The task of evaluating incoming calls to Emergency Medical Services (EMS) systems in order to determine the most appropriate response is performed in many different ways in current EMS systems. At one end of the spectrum, the process is entirely dependent on the judgement of professionals, while at the other end protocols specify the exact questions to be asked and corresponding decisions. This case study describes the experience of the Montreal EMS system, Urgences sant\u00e9, where professional telephone evaluation performed by nurses since 1981 was replaced by a protocolized system in 1992. During the professional era, there were many attempts to formalize the nurses' decision-making process. These first revealed that professional judgement tended to override decision-support tools that did not allow a flexible processing of the information spontaneously provided by callers. Second, the choice of a single protocol for each call was unnatural for professionals who could spontaneously integrate multiple aspects of a problem in parallel. Third, when protocols were used by professionals, it was a posteriori in order to document their decisions rather than actually support them. Fourth, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods in order to formalize professional judgement revealed its great complexity, which was confirmed by cognitive analyses of the nurses' decision-making processes. In particular, decisions of not sending EMS resources seemed to be the most difficult. These unsuccessful attempts at formalizing professional judgement led to an evaluation of its performance in terms of results, i.e. to which extent actual decisions minimized errors (both false positives and false negatives) and decision times. A random sample of 1006 calls was collected and the ideal decision was determined by concensus of experts for each call based on the patient's clinical condition. This theoretical decision was considered as a goal standard to which actual decisions were compared. Data analysis revealed that sensitivity of telephone triage (i.e. decision to send EMS resources or not) was almost perfect and specificity was 0.55. The necessary compromise between sensitivity and specificity varied with the types of decisions. Decision times were related to the urgency of the situations, more urgent calls being processed more rapidly. These results were interpreted as representing sophisticated optimization processes in professional judgement. The professional system was replaced by a non-professional protocolized system in 1992. This new system has not yet been formally evaluated in terms of results, but many sources of evidence suggest that it was accompanied by a deterioration of performance. Many contextual factors influence the organization of telephone assessment in EMS systems. This case study suggests that professional judgement may be most useful in contexts where the demand for EMS services often exceeds the availability of resources. On the other hand, protocolized systems may be more appropriate in the absence of such constraints, and where the litigation context prohibits the occurrence of any false negative.",

            "paperAbstract": "Abstract During the 1980s, a community of artificial intelligence researchers became interested in formalizing problem solving methods (PSMs) as part of an effort called \u201csecond-generation expert systems.\u201d We provide an example of how we are applying second-generation expert systems concepts in an agent-based system for space flight operations, the orbital communications adapter mirroring system (OCAMS), which was developed in the Brahms multiagent framework. Brahms modeling language provides an ontology for simulating work practices, including groups, agents, activities, communications, movements, and geographic areas. Activities are a behavioral unit of analysis to be contrasted with tasks, a functional unit of analysis. Problem solving occurs in the context of activities in the service of tasks; appropriate PSMs depend on the context: which people/roles are participating, what tools are available, how the results will be evaluated, and so forth. A work practice simulation facilitates designing workflow tools that appropriately interact with the physical and organizational context in which work occurs. OCAMS was developed using a simulation-to-implementation methodology, in which a prototype workflow tool was embedded in a Brahms simulation of how people would use the tool. The reusable components in a workflow system like OCAMS include entire \u201cproblem solvers\u201d (e.g., a planning subsystem), interoperability frameworks, and agents that inspect and change the world. Thus, a tool kit for building workflow tools requires more than a library of PSMs, which play a relatively small role in the overall multiagent, systems-integration architecture. Our research concern has shifted to situations that may arise that are outside the OCAMS' capability. In practical decision making, people must reflect on the validity of their models. As programs becoming actors in the workplace, we need to develop systems that help people to understand the limitations of the models that drive the automated operations, which means in part detecting when the formalizations in the system are inadequate.",

The problem is challenging because the mission time is limited, the agent is only provided with partial a priori information, and the amount of information that the sensor can measure is dependent on the range and the azimuth of the explorer with respect to the object. A sequential decision problem (path planning) is posed that incorporates the potential loss of the classification outcome that is made by an autonomous moving agent. The problem is solved using stochastic dynamic programming. The resulting path exploits the interaction between the agent kinematics, informatics, and classification. Numerical simulation results that validate the concept are presented.",

            "title": "Towards an Adaptive Approach for Distributed Resource Allocation in a Multi-agent System for Solving Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problems",
            "paperAbstract": "Introduction. The existing problem of continuous planning in transportation logistics requires the solving of dynamic Vehicle Routing Problems (dynamic VRPs) which is an NP-complete optimization problem. The task of continuous planning assumes the existence of individual commit times for orders to be released for execution with specific commitment strategies and is similar to the problem of maintaining a guaranteed response time in real-time systems that, in a dynamic environment, applies additional restrictions on planning algorithms. This paper describes the developed multi-agent platform for solving the dynamic multi-vehicle pickup and delivery problem with soft time windows (dynamic m-PDPSTW) that supports goaldriven behavior of autonomous agents with a multi-objective decision-making model. Further research on the design of adaptive mechanisms for run-time feedback-directed adjustment of scheduling algorithms through learning and experience of applied decision options is outlined. The market-based method for distributed dynamic resource allocation. The authors\u2019 multi-agent approach to continuous planning in complex uncertain environments implements the concept of the dynamic distributed resource allocation (Modi et al. 2002) whereby decision making is carried out by means of asynchronous quasi-parallel processes of negotiation between the agents of resources and the agents of orders which are working distributively in a virtual marketplace over all the agents of the complex shared ontology object. Goal-driven behavior of autonomous agents is supported by the developed multiobjective decision-making model based on individual goals, criteria, and preference functions defined in the virtual marketplace ontology and methods of agent self-appraisal and decision-making strategies (priority of criteria, value superposition, and homeostasis). In the implemented framework for agent knowledge representation, based on Prof. Marvin Minsky\u2019s concept of frames, each autonomous agent in the virtual marketplace has its individual knowledge, agent memory with a dynamic decision-making table, experience of applied deciCopyright \u00a9 2007, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. sion options, and reality representation of the world model (a shared ontological scene of reality) in an individual ontological scene and has its own perception via sensors and facades (Chevelev et al. 2006). The presented process of self-organization in such a multi-agent system is based on the constant search to maintain a dynamic balance among the interests of all participants in the interaction by means of an economically decentralized method of agent behavioral coordination. The microeconomic model defines violation functions of agent preferences with personal accounts for agents and reflects individual expenses and profits for all agents at any moment of distributed decision-making process. Furthermore, this microeconomic model provides the basis for decentralized mechanisms for controlling emergent behavior and stabilizing of agent swarms. Control methods of self-organization in complex environments. Conducted experiments on agent microeconomic parameters demonstrates that the complex system of interacting autonomous agents is characterized by the opportunity of the existence of several stable equilibria (attractors), by the unpredictable nonlinear processes of transitions between them, and by the emergence of resonating and oscillatory properties in the system. Special attention was given to the simulated processes of the significant internal reconfiguration of the agent system in response to the smallest external signals (a catastrophe) \u2013 trifling alterations on the agent local level led to a large-scale schedule reconstruction. Effective control mechanisms for selforganization need to be developed to make multi-agent systems more effective in solving dynamic VRPs with a view to achieving practical levels of performance for continuous planning in complex environments with higher levels of uncertainty, such as multi-modal logistics with multiple, competing companies. The developed mechanisms provide control methods for achieving both of the contending objectives: the transition of the multi-agent system toward the global quasi-optimal state while avoiding undesirable local attractors and the stabilization of agent activity and limitation of schedule reconstruction for maintaining a guaranteed response time for orders to be scheduled and released for execution according to their individual commitment times.",

To enable flexible human-agent collaboration to develop expert teams, our framework suitably represents team members\u2019 roles and capabilities, represents tasks and environments, reasons simultaneously about task decomposition and team formation, and coordinates human experts and software agents.

            "paperAbstract": "Economic, ecology and business systems are often complex systems, and are almost always characterized by imprecision and uncertainty. It is known that in such cases distributed multi-agent intelligent system based on soft computing is the most effective approach for systems analysis, decision making, and control in such systems. The key problem in constructing such systems is the problem of granulation, i.e., decomposition of the monolith intelligence of the whole system into autonomous agents' intelligence. The work suggests a method for creation of optimal knowledge bases of coordinating and cooperating intelligent agents. The optimization includes determination of a rational number of autonomous agent and fuzzy rules, optimal scaling factors, shapes and centers of membership functions of fuzzy rules of agents' knowledge bases, and optimal inference engine by using genetic algorithms. Computer simulation of the multi-agent distributed system for marketing-mix decision support system and demand forecasting are provided.",

            "paperAbstract": "Engineering design informatics is the creation, development, and application of advanced computing, information, and communication technologies in design, and has long been a topic of central importance in design practice and research. It has for many years involved techniques for the modeling of the designed artifact and evaluation of its through-life performance; for exploration of the design space; for the capture, organization, and delivery of information and knowledge relating to the artifact and the design process; and for support of the designer and design team including in the generation of new and improved design solutions. In recent years a strong emphasis has emerged on techniques to handle large sets of data and information-rich digital objects. In this Special Issue devoted to engineering design informatics, insights are presented into its theoretical and methodological basis and application from leading research teams around the globe. Engineering design informatics impacts the consideration of all stages of the artifact life cycle, from requirements planning and formulation through concept generation, embodiment and detail design, manufacture, and use to end of life. Recent developments in the subject in these contexts have drawn extensively on developments in formal representations, as may be seen in the first two papers in this Special Issue, presenting \u201cAn Ontological Approach to Engineering Requirement Representation and Analysis\u201d and \u201cA Formal Functional Representation Methodology for Conceptual Design of Material Flow-Processing Devices.\u201d The first paper, by Alolika Mukhopadhyay and Farhad Ameri, presents and evaluates a formal ontology for standard representation of engineering requirements, using explicit semantics to make the ontology amenable to automated reasoning. It demonstrates services for analysis and evaluation in design based on the ontology. The second paper, by Yong Chen, Meng Zhou, Ying Liu, and Youbai Xie, again uses an ontology-based approach, this time for representing desired material flow-processing functions in a formal and unambiguous manner in order to support a simulation-based retrieval approach to enable search for suitable solution principles for desired material flow-processing functions. In contrast, \u201cAutomatic Derivation of Design Schemata and Subsequent Generation of Designs,\u201d by Kate Reed and Duncan Gillies, describes an approach that explores a design space by building a schema as a list of rules that describe an area of the design space that will produce a design (a chair) with a particular property. The approach uses properties such as comfort and stability to define the spaces, and through a combination of multiple schemata and using decision trees to learn the schemata use machine learning to deal with discontinuous design spaces. The fourth paper, \u201cProduct Life Cycle Management Approach for Integration of Engineering Design and Life Cycle Engineering,\u201d by Diana Penciuc, Julien Le Duigou, Joanna Daaboul, Flore Vallet, and Beno\u0131\u0302t Eynard, is also concerned with approaches that can be used in the early phases of product design, but in this case to provides a method for decision support by integrating through-life sustainability assessment into product life cycle management. The paper demonstrates how an informatics approach can pull together the viewpoints of multiple disciplines in the reengineering of a traditional process. The topics of decision support and ontologies come together in the next paper, \u201cOntology-Based Executable Design Decision Template Representation and Reuse,\u201d by Zhenjun Ming, Yan Yan, Guoxin Wang, Jitesh H. Panchal, Chung-Hyun Goh, Janet K. Allen, and Farrokh Mistree, which presents an ontology-based tool to support the designer in decision making. The authors emphasize in their paper the distinction between a decision-support construct in their ontology providing an analytical tool or approach in which decisions are mathematically formulated and rationally made and an information perspective through templates in a frame-based ontology. Together these facilitate reuse, consistency, maintaining, and rapid execution in multiobjective design decision making. Design decisions are also an important element in design rationale: capture of the options considered in a design process and of the reasoning behind the choices that are made. Once captured, design rationale can be an effective basis for the reuse of design knowledge.

            "paperAbstract": "Risk attitude reflects an intelligent agent\u2019s preference for different uncertain rewards. Cost is the resource consumed; wealth is the total amount of the resource an agent holds. In a risk-aware system whose risk attitude is not independent of wealth, utility is a function of wealth. Given the utility function is one-switch, if we simply use cost based utility functions for the reasoning, unless the initial wealth is zero, we cannot precisely obtain the optimum preference in every decision step. A\u00a0bridge algorithm between cost and wealth helps us solve this problem. We provide a framework of the bridge algorithm for risk-aware Markov decision processes. We present an example of the block-world problem to explain the algorithm.An effective bridge algorithm helps planners to make reasonable decisions according to their risk attitudes, without changing the structure of Markov domains. A\u00a0bridge between cost and wealth enables us to deal with planning domains using the powerful backward induction approach instead of decision tree. This will have profound theoretical and realistic influence on artificial intelligence, economics, health care, as well as other areas concerning risk.",

In essence, expert systems use computer programs to accumulate the experience of experts in a given field and then provide either solutions to complex problems or explanations as aids to decision-making. These systems are particularly good at providing information related to problems of a technical nature. However, recent research and literature from the fields of AI, psychology, curriculum theory, management education, professional decision-making and the sociology of knowledge has begun to emphasize the need for approaches to knowledge which go beyond the \"technical\" and incorporate perspectives of a more \"practical\" and \"critical\" nature. It would suggest that designers of expert systems be aware of their epistemological assumptions\u2014that is assumptions about the nature and structure of knowledge and how it might be acquired. This paper elaborates on both traditional and emerging conceptions of learning and knowledge and then discusses the challenges presented to designers of expert systems, as well as higher education, in incorporating forms of knowledge that go beyond the technical.",

            "title": "Route selection for minimizing interference to primary users in Cognitive Radio Networks: A Reinforcement Learning approach",
            "paperAbstract": "The dynamicity and unpredictability of channel availability in Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) have imposed a major challenge to the design of routing schemes. Generally speaking, routing enables Secondary Users (SUs) to select optimal routes, while minimizing interference to Primary Users (PUs), which is a key requirement of CRNs. Nevertheless, there has been limited research in the literature for routing schemes that consider both SUs' interference to PUs and network-wide performance of SUs. This paper proposes a novel Cognitive Radio Q-routing (CRQ-routing) scheme, which aims to take account of SU-to-PU interference and SUs' end-to-end delay. Traditionally, routing schemes have been designed for specific applications and may not achieve the optimum network-wide performance in most kinds of network scenarios. In this paper, CRQ-routing has been shown to achieve network-wide performance in scenarios with various levels of channel dynamicity and unpredictability in regards to PU activities. Furthermore, CRQ-routing is simple to implement since it does not require additional hardware or geographical information. Basically, CRQ-routing is a Reinforcement Learning- (RL-) based approach that provides intelligence to SUs so that they can learn to make dynamic and efficient routing decisions on the fly while addressing the important characteristics of CRNs namely, dynamicity and unpredictability of channel availability, and SUs' interference to PUs. Simulation results show that CRQ-routing reduces the interference to PUs for up to 43% compared to traditional routing schemes, and it achieves lower end-to-end delay under highly unpredictable PU activities.",

The development of a driving simulator was part of a bigger project that evaluated a prototype Head-Up Display (HUD) interface. We therefore opted for a custom simulator that could effectively adapt to the needs of the given experiment. This paper presents the challenges we encountered during the implementation of realistic artificial intelligence (AI) in the traffic vehicles, which produced the analogous complexity driving events. A discussion follows regarding the design and modelling challenges of the robot drivers involved in the simulated accident scenarios. The paper discusses the outcomes of the user trials, suggests solutions to intriguing problems that derived from the experiment and reveals the phasma of our future work.",

            "paperAbstract": "Public safety has been a great concern in recent years as terrorism occurs everywhere. When a public event is held in an urban environment like Olympic games or soccer games, it is important to keep public safe and at the same time, to have a specific plan to control and rescue the public in the case of a terrorist attack. In order to better position public safety in communities against potential threats, it is of utmost importance to identify existing gaps, define priorities and focus on developing approaches to address those. In this paper, we present a system which aims at providing a decision support, threats response planning and risk assessment. Threats can be in the form of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE). In order to assess and manage possible risks of such attacks, we have developed a computational framework of simulating terrorist attacks, crowd behaviors, and police or safety guards' rescue missions. The characteristics of crowd behaviors are modeled based on social science research findings and our own virtual environment experiments with real human participants. Based on gender and age, a person has a different behavioral characteristic. Our framework is based on swarm intelligence and agent-based modeling, which allows us to create a large number of people with specific behavioral characteristics. Different test scenarios can be created by importing or creating 3D urban environments and putting certain terrorist attacks (such as bombs or toxic gas) on specific locations and time-lines.",

            "paperAbstract": "As knowledge is usually heterogeneous, voluminous, poorly structured and steadily evolving, its automated use in practice is extremely difficult. These limitations remain the main blocking element for creating advanced, adaptive business processes providing intelligent assistance. In this paper we propose to extend the typical business process development view, mainly focusing on services composition, with a business intelligence view which aims to support the design of complex, automatically reconfigurable services. To fulfil this objective, we designed an approach that consists in setting up an intelligent environment based on a context-aware concepts ontology of business processes and on related context handling rules for services orchestration. It\u2019s a generic method that enables to capture and to granulate the knowledge into a set of models that support dynamic business processes management. We demonstrate the relevance of this approach for the design of automatic and personalised decision support services orchestration based on a core ontology.",

This representation has so high flexibility that it can be extendedly used to decision support systems (DSS) for many variants of VRP. The work of this paper enriches the theory of model representation in DSS. It decreases the deficiencies of model representation in DSS and reduces complexities existing in the process of solving VRP in logistics distribution systems of e-commerce, which sets foundations for real-time scheduling and routing",

            "title": "In memory of Clive L. Dym",
            "paperAbstract": "The current and past Editors of AI EDAM note with sadness the passing on May 3, 2016, of Clive Dym, the Founding Editor of this Journal. Information about Clive\u2019s accomplishments can be found at two web locations (https://www.hmc.edu/remembering-clivedym/clive-dym-obituary/ and http://nac.designsociety.org/ en/article/3/in_memoriam_clive_dym_1942-2016), so we will not repeat the details of a lifetime of significant contributions to design theory, practice, and pedagogy. Clive\u2019s first issue of AI EDAM was February 1, 1987, and he almost lived long enough to see the 30th anniversary of his Journal. He wrote a \u201cHappy 20th Birthday, AI EDAM\u201d editorial in 2007. He was thrilled when it reached its 25th year, but slightly surprised to see it last that long. He was Editor in Chief from 1987 until 1996. Clive kept an interest in how the Journal was progressing after his 10 years as Editor. For a while he was regularly consulted about key concerns. That eased off gradually over the years, as he left it to his successors to carry the torch, although he always had an opinion about potential new editors. He was enthusiastic about the Journal having significantly more special issues, so that it could consistently provide clusters of papers about cutting edge topics. David C. Brown, the Journal\u2019s third editor, remembers that Clive sought him out to discuss the founding of the Journal, because he was concerned about its potential impact and survival. D.C.B. ended up being appointed as Book Review Editor; but it was decided after awhile that this was not sustainable, and reviews were eventually dropped from the Journal. Clive selected a distinguished set of people to serve as the inaugural Editorial Board and convinced a publisher that the concept was both viable and important. Before starting the Journal, Clive had been actively involved with the ground-breaking PRIDE design expert system at Xerox and was enthusiastic about the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on engineering, and engineering design in particular. He coauthored an influential book in 1991 on knowledge-based systems in engineering, continuing to demonstrate his enthusiasm for AI applications. His book still remarkably receives a few citations every year. In 1991 he published with Yan Jin, the current Editor in Chief, a paper about multidisciplinary design decision making using AI techniques. His publishing record is distinguished by his connections with many coauthors across a variety of topics. For example, his most cited paper on engineering design pedagogy has four coauthors. In 1994 he authored the monograph Engineering Design: A Synthesis of Views that attempted to show how AI\u2019s reasoning and representation methods applied quite naturally to defining design and to modeling designing. This marked a strong break from the pervasive \u201cdesign as analysis\u201d point of view. Almost 20 years later, at the time of his retirement, he was concerned that, although the fundamental ideas in the book were still true and relevant, AI had moved on. As a consequence he enlisted the help of D.C.B. to update the book to include explicit descriptions of relevant modern AIbased representations and reasoning, layering the new material over the text of the original. In retirement he kept threatening to update all of his other books! William P. Birmingham, the Journal\u2019s second editor, remembers that just prior to Clive turning over the editorship, he expressed deep interest in the Journal\u2019s direction. They had many interesting and fruitful discussions about unfolding events in the field and the direction of the Journal. Handing over the Journal to someone new was difficult, because Clive had spent considerable effort developing it. He wanted the Journal to continue its editorial direction while still engaging new areas. Of course, he also wanted the Journal to maintain high academic standards. Throughout his years of being Editor, W.P.B. relied on Clive for advice. That advice transcended the Journal. As a young faculty member trying to get a career started, he enjoyed Clive\u2019s wisdom about everything from research to teaching to navigating academe. W.P.B. fondly remembers long phone calls with Clive and getting together at conferences. Y.J., the Journal\u2019s fourth editor, stresses Clive\u2019s community building and mentoring role. Clive envisioned that there was an intellectual framework of design that could be articulated and modeled, and therefore taught and researched. This conviction led him to establish a journal that has played a critical role in providing a forum for and developing a community of those who had similar thoughts about the utility of AI in design and analysis. In 1997, Clive organized the first biannual Mudd Design Workshop. Through eight workshops over a span of almost two decades, Clive built a substantial community of faculty Artificial Intelligence for Engineering Design, Analysis and Manufacturing (2016), 30, 333\u2013334. # Cambridge University Press 2016 0890-0604/16 doi:10.1017/S0890060416000317",

            "paperAbstract": "Illicit trade in tobacco products (ITTP) would severely disrupt the market order, greatly threaten citizen's health, and damage the interests of the nation and the consumers, which has attracted great attention of tobacco monopoly administration. Quick and correct detection of the changes and the drivers of ITTP activity would be very significant to the surveillance, tracing, early warning, prediction, prevention and control of the illicit tobacco trade, which are very important challenges for tobacco monopoly administrations in China. In this paper, we introduce spatial-temporal analysis techniques into detecting the spatial-temporal patterns and drivers of ITTP based on the dataset provided by tobacco monopoly administration of Changsha county in Hunan province, China. The results suggested that ITTP in the county mostly occurred along the downtown-county borders, or nearby the toll stations located on the highway, logistics and freight distribution center and the junction of neighboring areas. Positive correlations were found between illegal rate and population density, the number of kindergartens and nursery schools, proximity to the borders, the number of the pupils and the middle school students, which was consistent with the previous study and social etiquette. This study could provide important intelligence and clues for the decision makers and make sure that the resources should be allocated as effectively as possible.",

Robust behavior requires that uncertainty be accommodated in the robot control system, especially when autonomy is desired. Fuzzy logic control technology enables development of controllers which can provide the necessary computational intelligence in real-time. This paper presents the incorporation of fuzzy logic, into the framework of behavior-based control. An architecture for hierarchical behavior control is presented in which control decisions result from a consensus of behavioral recommendations. Multiple fuzzy-behavior coordination is discussed and applied to autonomous navigation without explicit maps. Performance and robustness is demonstrated by implementation on a mobile robot with significant mechanical imperfections.",

            "paperAbstract": "Affective engineering is being increasingly used to describe a systematic approach to the analysis of consumer reactions to candidate designs. It has evolved from Kansei engineering, which has reported improvements in products such as cars, electronics, and food. The method includes a semantic differential experiment rating candidate designs against bipolar adjectives (e.g., attractive\u2013not attractive, traditional\u2013not traditional). The results are statistically analyzed to identify correlations between design features and consumer reactions to inform future product developments. A number of key challenges emerge from this process. Clearly, suitable designs must be available to cover all design possibilities. However, it is also paramount that the best adjectives are used to reflect the judgments that participants might want to make. The current adjective selection process is unsystematic, and could potentially miss key concepts. Poor adjective choices can result in problems such as misinterpretation of an experimental question, clustering of results around a particular response, and participants' confusion from unfamiliar adjectives that can be difficult to consider in the required context (e.g., is this wristwatch \u201coppressive\u201d?). This paper describes an artificial intelligence supported process that ensures adjectives with appropriate levels of precision and recall are developed and presented to participants (and thus addressing problems above) in an affective engineering study in the context of branded consumer goods. We illustrate our description of the entire concept expansion and reduction process by means of an industrial case study in which participants were asked to evaluate different designs of packaging for a laundry product. The paper concludes by describing the important advantages that can be gained by the new approach in comparison with previous approaches to the selection of consumer focused adjectives.",

            "paperAbstract": "This book contains no mention of computers, let alone Artificial Intelligence. None the less it contains much of relevance to current concerns of Artificial Intelligence and Law, because it deals with the nature of legal argument. The realisation that an understanding of legal argument is a central challenge of AI and Law came very early; Thorne McCarty\u2019s pioneering work on TAXMAN aimed to reconstruct the arguments of the majority and dissenting judgements in a leading tax case. The work of Edwina Rissland, Kevin Ashley, Vincent Aleven and others has explored the ways in which arguments are constructed on the basis of case precedents. Jaap Hage, Henry Prakken, Giovanni Sartor, Bart Verheij, Ron Loui and others have used logical tools and the concept of argument to explain how rational decisions can be made when rules conflict. Tom Gordon, Arno Lodder, myself and others, have modelled the consideration of legal issues as a formal dialogue game in which disputing parties argue their case. These, and other uses of argument, such as for explanation of the reasoning of legal knowledge based systems, have confirmed this central role of argument in AI and Law. For an overview of argument in AI and Law up to the mid-1990s, see Bench-Capon (1997). Since then interest in argument has even increased. All this excellent work has done much to suggest ways in which arguments can be generated, analysed and used in legal reasoning. What it has not addressed with much success is the question of what, given two conflicting arguments, makes one argument more convincing than another. In a 1985 paper, written with Marek Sergot, and published as Bench-Capon and Sergot (1988), the concluding sentence was:",

The basis premise of MACS is to do maintenance through understanding. MACS views the application from several perspectives in specific 'worlds'. One of them is the 'reasoning world', which captures by means of a simple formalism, the problem-solution-decision formalism, the rationale underlying the design and maintenance process. MACS data integration is provided by a central base called the interconnection world. Moreover, MACS proposes to guide the maintainer in applying a strategy and in fully exploiting the possibilities of the MACS tools themselves by means of artificial-intelligence techniques and knowledge-based support.<<ETX>>",

HyperNets semantics is based on point to set functions and constraint theories. We associate a graphical representation to a point to set representation of HyperNets. The reachability set is characterized by fixed point semantics. The correctness and completeness of a nondeterministic semi decision algorithm for the accessibility problem is proved. This algorithm also gives five sequences. High level Petri nets then appear as a particular case of HyperNets. We have implemented a version of this algorithm for linear HyperNets in the MINOS system. Then the representation of a classical artificial intelligence problem is proposed: we show its HyperNets representation, and its MINOS simulation.",

            "paperAbstract": "Various law enforcement and intelligence tasks require managing identity information in an effective and efficient way. However, the quality issues of identity information make this task non-trivial. Various heuristic based systems have been developed to tackle the identity matching problem. However, deploying such systems may require special expertise in system configuration and customization for optimal system performance. In this paper, we propose an alternative system called the Arizona IDMatcher. The system relies on a machine learning algorithm to automatically generate a decision model for identity matching. Such a system requires minimal human configuration effort. Experiments show that the Arizona IDMatcher is very efficient in detecting matching identity records. Compared to IBM Identity Resolution (a commercial, heuristic-based system), the Arizona IDMatcher achieves better recall and overall F-measures in identifying matching identities in two large-scale real-world datasets.",

Based on sensory information from the external environment, living things make decisions and actions for surviving and adapting in dynamic environments. The driving force for adaptation is mainly learning and genetic inheritance (evolution). Intelligent robots also need the adapting ability. The intelligence of a robot emerges as the result of the synthesis of local modules by the simultaneous processing of perception, decision making and action. Consequently, the intelligence depends on the structure for processing information on the hardware and software. Therefore, we propose a robotic system with structured intelligence. A robot with structured intelligence adapts to environment and acquires skill and knowledge through the interaction with the dynamic environment by computational intelligence including neural network, fuzzy system and genetic algorithm.",

The communication feature of a smart sensor is compulsory. It must communicate vertically and horizontally too. The vertically communication is down with the process it senses and up with a processing and decision system. The horizontally communication is with other smart sensors. There are several ways for communicating: with direct physical connections, wireless, by Internet or combined. This paper describes an Internet connected smart sensor. The sensed parameter is the temperature but it can be applied to other parameters too. The Web connected smart sensor is made by a TINI platform, a LM75A temperature sensor and the appropriate software. The sensor is connected to the TINI platform through a I2C interface.",

            "paperAbstract": "The primary focus of research in artificial intelligence (AI) and law has been the development of computational models of legal problem solving. Underlying this focus is the assumption that developing such models will lead both to a better understanding of the cognitive and logical basis of legal reasoning and to the construction of intelligent legal information systems (ILISs) of practical utility [McCarty 1990]. Relatively little emphasis, by contrast, has been directed to assessing the ultimate impact that emerging intelligent legal information systems technology will have on the practice of law or on society in general. Much of the reason for this neglect is that the immaturity of the field makes it difficult to anticipate precisely what successful ILISs will be like. However, analysis of the potential benefits and pitfalls of the widespread use of this technology is important, if for no other reason than to focus research in directions most likely to lead to socially beneficial and professionally acceptable applications. Computers, Artificial Intelligence and the Law, edited by Mervyn Bennun, Faculty of Law at Exeter University, is a collection of six papers that explore the interplay between computational models of legal reasoning and the institutions that such models are most likely to affect. A cautionary tone is set by the volume's introduction, which stresses that \"uncritical use of technology does not solve human problems and create a better life.\" The first chapter, AI and the Law: Proceed with Caution, by Blay Whitby, elaborates upon this theme, arguing that successful ILISs may have significant, unexpected social effects. In common with other forms of automation, ILISs may lead to 'deskilling', the replacement of skilled workers by automated systems. A second and more subtle effect is a possible shift in power from the judiciary to the legislature. While ILISs may lead to greater consistency, and therefore greater predictability in interpretation of the law, the cost of this increased consistency is a diminished role for members of the judiciary empowered to interpret the law. Thus, there is a danger that designers of ILISs may become unelected participants in the process of social and political negotiation between the legislature and the judiciary. The practical issues that arise in fielding a large-scale ILIS are the subject of a case-study by Julie Browne and Andrew Taylor of a decision support system developed for the British Department of Health and Social Security to assist adjudication officers in determining entitlement to social security benefits. J Browne and Taylor encountered a number of difficult",

            "title": "DSS: directions for the next decade",
            "paperAbstract": "The idea of organizing a special issue about the next decade of DSS was borrowed from Keen\u2019s paper (1987) in which certain predictions were made. Now, almost 15 years later, we are witnessing an unparalleled digital revolution brought by the Internet, intranets, superb multimedia and powerful and relatively inexpensive computing and storage facilities. With the increased number of new business models and e-commerce applications, we were interested to find out how DSS has been changed and what the DSS might look like in the next decade. Of the many papers that were submitted to the special issue, we selected what we believe represent some of the most important trends in DSS research and implementation. However, before we present the essentials of the six selected papers, let us look at some of the most visible changes that are relevant to DSS. One of the changes that already occurred is the name of this journal which was expanded to include electronic commerce. Journals do not change names too often. However, as explained by the editors, the new name reflects the changing business environment and the recognition that electronic commerce is a major revolution that impacts, among other things, managerial decision-making processes. Similar changes occurred in many other DSS-related concepts. For example, the term DSS itself is seen less and less frequently both in the trade journals and in the vendors\u2019 Web sites. Instead, terms such as business intelligence and OLAP are very popular. As a matter of fact, these terms practically eliminated the term executive information systems (EIS) from most vendors\u2019 Web pages and product lists. There is an increased recognition that business intelligence, which integrates many of the EIS, DSS and expert systems concepts, is becoming a necessary component in the second generation of enterprise systems, such as ERP, as well as in extremely integrated enterprise systems that include CRM and ecommerce components. Furthermore, this concept becomes highly related to data mining, which are incorporated into e-commerce, collaborative commerce and other derivatives of the digital revolution [5]. Even futuristic topics such as mobile-commerce recognize the need to incorporate decision support in resolving issues such as investing in advertisement, which is based on customers\u2019 location. An example of the changes in the practical world is the inclusion of Web-based products and services in practically any DSS and especially in EIS-related vendors of the 1990s. The early definitions of decision support systems (DSS) focused on four novelties: (i) methods and instruments for dealing with unstructured or semistructured problems, which formed an improvement on management science and operations research methodology; (ii) interactive computer-based systems, which were built for managers and were more advanced than descriptive systems theory or traditional decision models; (iii) user-oriented systems, which formed a better platform for decision-making than batch-oriented MIS applications; and (iv) the separation of data and models in computer applications, which promised to form the basis for more effective modeling. The implications of these novelties promised to be three-fold: (i) decision-makers could, more effectively than before, deal with unstructured or semi-structured, difficult problems which up to that time required extensive experience and expert knowledge, as they had not been dealt within operations research or management science theory; (ii) decision-makers could make better and more reasoned decisions without using optimization tools and without mastering",

It has evolved from Kansei engineering, which has reported improvements in products such as cars, electronics, and food. The method includes a semantic differential experiment rating candidate designs against bipolar adjectives (e.g., attractive\u2013not attractive, traditional\u2013not traditional). The results are statistically analyzed to identify correlations between design features and consumer reactions to inform future product developments. A number of key challenges emerge from this process. Clearly, suitable designs must be available to cover all design possibilities. However, it is also paramount that the best adjectives are used to reflect the judgments that participants might want to make. The current adjective selection process is unsystematic, and could potentially miss key concepts. Poor adjective choices can result in problems such as misinterpretation of an experimental question, clustering of results around a particular response, and participants' confusion from unfamiliar adjectives that can be difficult to consider in the required context (e.g., is this wristwatch \u201coppressive\u201d?). This paper describes an artificial intelligence supported process that ensures adjectives with appropriate levels of precision and recall are developed and presented to participants (and thus addressing problems above) in an affective engineering study in the context of branded consumer goods. We illustrate our description of the entire concept expansion and reduction process by means of an industrial case study in which participants were asked to evaluate different designs of packaging for a laundry product. The paper concludes by describing the important advantages that can be gained by the new approach in comparison with previous approaches to the selection of consumer focused adjectives.",

If the data and analysis are available over the Web this promotes E-Business by connecting clientele worldwide. This paper describes such a predictive tool \"QuenchMiner\u2122\" in the domain \"Materials Science\". Data mining, more specifically the \"Apriori Algorithm\", is used to derive association rules that represent relationships between input conditions and results of domain experiments. This enables the tool to answer questions such as \"Given cooling medium and agitation during material heat treatment, predict cooling rate\". This allows users to perform case studies on the Web and use their results to optimize the involved processes, thus increasing customer satisfaction. Another interesting aspect is predicting material microstructure during heat treatment. Microstructure controls material properties such as hardness. Hence its prediction helps in making decisions about materials selection. Microstructure prediction has similarities to an artificial intelligence process called \"Game-of-Life\". Some challenges in our work are incorporating domain expert judgement while mining association rules, simulating microstructure evolution under different conditions, and dealing with uncertainty. These challenges and associated research issues are outlined here. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tool performing Web-based predictive analysis in Materials Science.",

            "paperAbstract": "Within the engineering design community there is support for further research into the development of improved approaches to design management. Such research has lead to coordination being identified as an important and pervasive characteristic of many existing approaches (e.g., concurrent engineering and work-flow management). In this article, operational design coordination is proposed as the basis for an improved approach. This article also presents a novel integrated approach that incorporates the key elements of operational design coordination: coherence, communication, task management, resource management, schedule management, and real-time support. Through unifying these key elements, this approach provides an integrated means of managing design in a controlled and harmonious fashion. The approach also provides knowledge of the constituent techniques involved in operational design coordination, the interrelationships and dynamic interactions between them, and the knowledge used and maintained within and between them. The approach has been realized within an agent-oriented system called the Design Coordination System, which provides a systematic means of simultaneously coordinating operational management tasks and technical design tasks. To evaluate the approach, the system has been applied to an industrial case study involving the computational process of turbine blade design. This application has been shown to enable the structured undertaking of interrelated tasks by allocating and using resources of varying performance efficiency in an optimized fashion in accordance with dynamically derived schedules in a coherent, appropriate, and timely manner. This is achieved by managing tasks, their dependencies, and the information required to undertake them. In addition, the approach enables and sustains the continuous optimized use of resources by monitoring, forecasting, and disseminating resource performance efficiency. The approach facilitates dynamic scheduling and the subsequent enactment of the resulting schedules. Decision making for rescheduling is also incorporated within the approach such that it is only performed as and when appropriate. If rescheduling is performed, it is done so in parallel with task enactment such that resources continue to be utilized in an optimized manner.",

The model comprises the complete process from the initiation of a trading order until its execution. The software agent paradigm is the framework for implementing the proposed model. The properties of intelligent software agents meet the characteristics of the actors on the trading floor and provide capabilities for efficient distributed computing. Because of the space restriction, the main focus of this paper is on stock broker agent, one of the most important agents in TrAgent. Intelligence is provided to the stock broker agent in order to make reasoning and decisions on the profitability of a firm. This intelligence is provided using fuzzy expert system. The paper further discusses the design and development issues concerning different components of the model",

The ability of dealing with unexpected events is one of the important aspects of robot intelligence. Robotic systems can obtain environmental information from sensors and respond to environmental information by making task decisions. According to the task decisions, the system is able to modify the original planned path and control the robot to execute the task autonomously. The event based hybrid system model has three layers, one continuous layer, and two discrete layers. The hybrid system model enables the robot system to make decisions and modify original path plans. Experimental results verified the proposed approach.",

In phase 1, many feature selection algorithms are utilized to select informative cancer-related genes from microarray expression data. Compared with other algorithms, our GSVM-RFE algorithm demonstrates superior performance on the microarray expression dataset for AML/ALL classification. Specifically, a compact \u201c perfect\u201d gene subset is reported. In phase 2, many intelligent computation models are implemented to extract useful knowledge about functions of selected genes to regulate the cancer being studied. Knowledge can ease further biomedical study because of reliable information sources, high prediction accuracy, and easiness to interpret. Currently, knowledge is represented in two formats, Web-based and Rule-based. As a future work, we plan to implement knowledge fusion algorithms in phase 3 to synthesize and consolidate hybrid knowledge into a single knowledge base to provide effective and efficient decision support for cancer diagnosis and drug discovery.",

This is logical because in going from teleoperation to robotics there would appear to be a continuous decrease in manned workload, an increase in system complexity, and an increase in the amount of \u201cintelligence\u201d in the automated system. During the past 10 years NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) has been involved in all three areas. The decision on which system is most suitable for a task depends not only on the task, but on the allocation of responsibility for intelligence or high level control. The operator may be responsible for all intelligence and control functions, they may be shared between the operator and the automated system, or they may be performed by an autonomous system. This paper discusses some of the experiences in each area in applications related to possible space tasks and some of the lessons learned.",

The success of direct marketing campaigns is directly related to the degree to which the campaign reaches its target group. Therefore the selection e.g. of the correct addressees of a mailing is a crucial step that already determines its outcome. However, the selection process is very complex and hardly automated even today. One of the important goals is to increase response rates in direct marketing. Based on data of customer profiles a response model is set up and it is then applied to select potential buyers of certain products for future mailings or telephone sales campaigns. In this paper a fuzzy clustering algorithm for customer segmentation of a financial institute is described. Based on these results, a decision tree model is used for database marketing of direct marketing products. The tasks of the data mining process from the conceptual design to the integrated business intelligence solution will be explained using a problem solving process model.",

But even if it is indeed a \"new kind of intelligence\", it can be argued that this intelligence is very basic. There is a long way to go until Deep Blue could be considered a fully autonomous agent, the type we are eagerly trying to build in AI and that we believe we will eventually be successful at. \n \nWe should not consider Deep Blue (or any software agent) fully autonomous until it can manage its own computational resources (memory and time), minimize risk and cost of various decisions, assess its errors and develop new representations of (chess) knowledge, and be able to cooperate and communicate with other computer and human chess players. \n \nWe feel indeed that Deep Blue falls somewhere non-trivial on the scale of intelligence. But to move further along that scale greater autonomy will be required: Is Deep Blue now selecting its own openings, deciding when and whether to play for a draw, etc? Does it generalize from its past experiences, annotate its own games etc.? Does it know that is has played the agent \"GKasparov\" before? That the match will last 6 games (like last time) etc. Can it apply the information or decision theoretic model on which it is choosing its moves to other operations management and control situations? Does Deep Blue know that one mistake against the World Champion could be fatal? Does it know that bishops can only reach one color square? Does it contain a declarative representation of the rules of chess?.",

            "paperAbstract": "OBJECTIVE\nHepatic fibrosis, the principal pointer to the development of a liver disease within chronic hepatitis C, can be measured through several stages. The correct evaluation of its degree, based on recent different non-invasive procedures, is of current major concern. The latest methodology for assessing it is the Fibroscan and the effect of its employment is impressive. However, the complex interaction between its stiffness indicator and the other biochemical and clinical examinations towards a respective degree of liver fibrosis is hard to be manually discovered. In this respect, the novel, well-performing evolutionary-powered support vector machines are proposed towards an automated learning of the relationship between medical attributes and fibrosis levels. The traditional support vector machines have been an often choice for addressing hepatic fibrosis, while the evolutionary option has been validated on many real-world tasks and proven flexibility and good performance.\n\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS\nThe evolutionary approach is simple and direct, resulting from the hybridization of the learning component within support vector machines and the optimization engine of evolutionary algorithms. It discovers the optimal coefficients of surfaces that separate instances of distinct classes. Apart from a detached manner of establishing the fibrosis degree for new cases, a resulting formula also offers insight upon the correspondence between the medical factors and the respective outcome. What is more, a feature selection genetic algorithm can be further embedded into the method structure, in order to dynamically concentrate search only on the most relevant attributes. The data set refers 722 patients with chronic hepatitis C infection and 24 indicators. The five possible degrees of fibrosis range from F0 (no fibrosis) to F4 (cirrhosis).\n\n\nRESULTS\nSince the standard support vector machines are among the most frequently used methods in recent artificial intelligence studies for hepatic fibrosis staging, the evolutionary method is viewed in comparison to the traditional one. The multifaceted discrimination into all five degrees of fibrosis and the slightly less difficult common separation into solely three related stages are both investigated. The resulting performance proves the superiority over the standard support vector classification and the attained formula is helpful in providing an immediate calculation of the liver stage for new cases, while establishing the presence/absence and comprehending the weight of each medical factor with respect to a certain fibrosis level.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe use of the evolutionary technique for fibrosis degree prediction triggers simplicity and offers a direct expression of the influence of dynamically selected indicators on the corresponding stage. Perhaps most importantly, it significantly surpasses the classical support vector machines, which are both widely used and technically sound. All these therefore confirm the promise of the new methodology towards a dependable support within the medical decision-making.",
